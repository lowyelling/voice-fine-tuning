Can't take the Arizona out of me. It wouldn't surprise me if we pass gun control legislation over a CEO and not dead kids though.\n\nI feel for Brian's family, especially his kids. They will be taunted by the video of his murder for the rest of their lives. I hope they get help.\n\nWhen the killer revealed skill and professionalism, I wondered if it was a hit job. The healthcare industry operates like a cartel so actual mafia techniques aren't too far fetched to me. Brian Thompson was being investigated over allegations of insider trading. A lot of people would kill for a lot less.\n\nThen reports emerged about the killer's slogan on bullet casings: Deny. Defend. Depose. Damn if that doesn't go hard. Undeniable bars. What a clever refutation of Delay, Defend, Deny.\n\nBy all accounts (*in mainstream media), Brian was a good person in his personal life. At the same time, he made millions off the suffering and death of countless Americans. He was both victim and killer, the face of the banality of evil.\n\nI try not to, but I do judge men by their girlfriends and wives. And Brian's wife dropped the best Onion headline ever with zero effort while grieving. She said that Brian was receiving threats over \"I don't know, a lack of coverage?\" +1 for peak comedy.\n\nBrian Thompson's unnamed murderer is likely a killer/victim too.\n\nHis killer should be brought to justice, no matter how noble his reasons. The courts will have a hard time finding an unbiased jury though, and jury nullification is always an option.\n\nThe reaction across the spectrum—left, right, Facebook normies, nurses and doctors, NYT and Zero Hedge and Ben Shapiro commenters—has been united in a way I haven't seen since 9/11. It's weirdly energizing, hopeful, yet extremely depressing at the same time.

Women do be the death of men.\n\nIn \"oh no he's hot\" news, women want to fuck the killer. I'm looking forward to all the hybristophilia fanfiction. The attention from women will absolutely influence future shooters, which would be a massive improvement to school shootings. Stop gunning down kids, fellas. RETVRN to impressing Jodie Foster.\n\nShinzo Abe's assassination probably started this vibe shift from mass killing kids to targeted, politically motivated shootings. There's 2 guns in all of Japan and they're both locked up in a cabinet, but Tetsuya Yamagami managed to make his own gun and kill Abe, avenging his family for falling prey to a cult with ties to powerful Japanese people like Abe. And Japan collectively went \"oh shit Yamagami had a point.\"\n\nHealthcare insurance companies have been removing executive photos and About Me pages, and Blue Cross Blue Shield reversed an anesthesia time limit policy yesterday. It would be very American to solve healthcare through gun violence. Likelier scenario though is they sneak that policy back on us in a few months. We're going to learn how to raw dog surgery when the news dies down.\n\nI'm personally not going to celebrate death, which applies across the board from American war criminals like Kissinger or for expected enemies like Osama bin Laden and Gaddafi.

I stopped tracking my net worth. Why was I, a naturally frugal person, obsessing over numbers on a screen? Crypto further helped numb me to wild double or triple digit swings; it really emphasized the fake nature of my obsession. Later, it dawned on me that my mental model of money was wrong, too.

The distance between what the public thinks AI can do and what people are actually doing with it right now is the widest it has ever been.\n\nThe average person probably still conceives of AI as a smart and fun chatbot or image generator. The curious person understands that AI can generate code in a fancy autocomplete sort of way. An engaged person might be following Andrej Karpathy tweets, but even top-level minds aren't properly explaining the frontier because the frontier is being built every second, so we end up with (probably true) memes like \"Billion-dollar unicorn startups by a single person are now possible.\" The real root is that most software engineering work—and probably most/all other corporate work—is no longer about the work itself. The real work is about solving the coordination of autonomous workers who don't eat, sleep, rest.\n\nI'm neither a techno-optimist nor dystopian, really more techno-ambivalent (Jacques Ellul) or techno-probabilistic (Josh Davila). Despite being more tech-critical, I'm into my third week at Fractal Tech AI software engineering bootcamp to peer into the frontier. Consider this the tech bro day 14 post that I skipped yesterday, since I really had to mull this one over. Because even though 50% of Fractal's program has to be rewritten every 3-4 months to keep up with the pace of AI, we're still not really keeping pace.\n\nEach week, I'm seeing some NYC engineers that are blowing my mind.\n\nPeople are token-maxxing and optimizing for price/token, commanding 10+ AI coding agents at once. A full workforce, a hivemind. Each AI agent is a worker bee with a separate role (writing code, reviewing it, handling merges, monitoring other worker bees etc). The queen bee engineer sits at the top and just describes what they want to build. How they do this can be wildly different—some engineers spend all day speaking English to their AI, and have their full-time Quality Assurance test engineer from the other side of the world review the ~20% edge cases while they sleep. Others draw intricate system diagrams with Mermaid and feed those plans to AI.\n\nVeteran engineer Steve Yegge built a whole orchestration system for this subagent workflow, likening it to Kubernetes.\n\nI didn't know what Kubernetes was, so I had Claude explain it to me. Kubernetes is the system that Google invented to manage thousands of servers. You don't need to say \"run this app on server #42\"—you just say \"I want 3 copies of this app running at all times\" and Kubernetes figures out the details. Now I see the pattern. As products are commoditized (become standardized), the value moves up to the coordination layer above.\n\nBarbell Economics - the middle is dying\n\nBefore I entered this program, I had a thesis: if AI solves software, it pushes the best engineers down the stack. Software is abstraction layered on abstraction, declarative layers on top of imperative cores, all the way down to physics. If AI handles the upper layers, then expertise migrates to the lower ones—hardware, materials science, manufacturing. Back to the real world where you fight with atoms, since not even AI agents can bend the speed of light. I had hoped this would trigger a manufacturing renaissance in the U.S.\n\nBut what I saw last week weren't the best minds going down toward physics. They were going up, actually—becoming pure coordination layers. So what's actually forming is a barbell where value concentrates at two extremes:\n\nAt the top: vision, taste, knowing what to build, directing the hive. The bottleneck here is imagination, agency, and our need to sleep.\n\nAt the bottom: atoms. Physics. Reality has the final say with semiconductor fabs, battery chemistry, rockets to Mars.\n\nBut the middle is being wiped out. Standard software engineering like webapps and what most people think of when they hear \"tech\" — that's dying. They're solved problems. Soon to be commodities, like servers.\n\nThere's still some time, of course. Anything that AI has the most training data on are solved problems. But building Solidity contracts on Ethereum is not a solved problem (yet). Modeling how to launch rockets is not a solved problem(yet??).\n\nNow apply what's happening to software engineering to almost every other corporate job."}]}

I was unprocessed, seeking an audience—a raw slab of meat bleeding out in public. It was unbecoming. Somewhat undignified. But worst of all, _too serious_.\n\nGuess who didn't get to speak at commencement.\n\nWhile I'm free of suicidal ideation now, I'm still not free from writing about suicide, sorry :) I used many normal and many weird methods to climb to a decent place, but coping with the absolute nadir was its own beast.\n\nFor me, this many-headed monster met its match with dark humor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# A Scream\n\nWhy did I want to kill myself? I was in good company; 1 person dies by suicide every 40 seconds. Sure, the world sucks and life is absurd and meaningless. But plenty of people keep rolling that boulder back up. There is no singular reason for suicide. \n\nBut what we do know is that suicide is a scream for help. A meaner or ignorant person might say it is a cry for attention, which…well, no shit. Someone who attempts suicide needed attention at some point—or many points—in their lives. They were cast aside or received the wrong kind of attention. As DFW wrote in _This is Water_ , “Most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.” \n\nSo why are people dead inside already? Also a complex question. \n\nMy culprit was trauma. All kinds of it, since I was a kid. Physical abuse, medical neglect, sexual violence, emotional damage. My body was smart and shielded me in every way it could. I know its survival methods worked because I live. But sometimes they worked too well. Long after the shocks, my body stayed tethered to the past, believing itself a watchful sentinel who guarded me from harm. But it became my warden instead, holding me hostage in that pitch-black pit. Trauma reverberated through time, severing me from others—and from myself. \n\nWhile severed, I lost the ability to trust myself. \n\nWhile severed, I confused violence for love and safety for horror. \n\nWhile severed, I thought suicide was the natural end and my final destiny. \n\nThe beast in the pit tore me apart. But dark humor came with thread and needle, weaving fibers between the severed pieces. I felt the stitches forming, a small rebellion. Laughing until I was in stitches, laughter stitching me back together, over and over again. \n\n# A Meme\n\nThat essay I wrote for the commencement speech? Thank God it wasn’t chosen, not only because of the cringe. Thank God it wasn’t chosen because I could have inspired a slew of suicides around me. Suicide has a funny tendency to spread, as if it were socially contagious. This copycat effect gives suicide a uniquely viral, meme-like quality. That’s why media must responsibly report on suicide, else we end up with a situation like Anthony Bourdain, who killed himself in a similar fashion to Kate Spade two days after her death.\n\nNow hold on. Isn’t joking about suicide pretty irresponsible? Wouldn’t suicide memes increase suicide contagion? It’s a great question, and the public health community debates the question with compelling evidence for either side. \n\nFor me, dark jokes about suicide worked. Laughter needs no overwrought explanation; it lives in my gut. Give me all the suicide memes—they cut through the static in my brain, interrupt all my thoughts. That many-headed beast? It was my own mind, my own thoughts replicating _kill yourself kill yourself kill yourself_. \n\nThe great hydra is a mind virus and suicide is one strange, strange meme. But humor is a meme too; it spreads just as fast, if not faster. There’s no better way to counter a dark meme than with an even blacker one. \n\nIn meme-on-meme warfare, may the best meme win. \n\n# A Killer Joke\n\nThreads of dark humor stitched me together. But it was communal laughter that turned the threads into something stronger, a rope I grabbed onto with all my might that slung me up from the bottom. Why were dark jokes shared among friends and online communities so effective for coping with suicide? For me, making a killer joke about suicide in good company took away its power.\n\nSo let me tell you a killer joke.\n\nA Swiss suicide startup claims they’ve got a “peaceful exit” pod in the woods. All mentally terminal people can die with dignity at just 18 Swiss francs a pop. \n\nAn American woman wants to kill herself. She is the perfect client, riddled with physical pain. She presses the button from inside the pod. Her death is an achievement, they claim. \n\nExcept she is found with strangulation marks around her throat. Only one witness was there, the CEO. He is arrested.\n\nThe machine didn’t work, so the CEO strangled her. \n***"}]}

We crammed into a dingy, narrow building with flickering lights and frayed carpeting, sidestepping cracks all over the sidewalk.

No, God was a glass noodle dish brimming with wood ear mushrooms, carrots, and cabbage. He lived in the potluck line, in every steaming bowl families brought as a show of care. Those communal lunches were my Eden. Better than stickers.\n\nA few years later my life began to echo _Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret_. Like Judy Blume’s heroine, I swapped a city apartment for a suburban house, and soon I was church-hopping across Phoenix with my family, testing altars and aisles the way Margaret sampled synagogues and steeples. We joined one congregation twice a week—Thursday nights as well as Sundays. It was everything our dingy Fremont church wasn’t: a sprawling campus of new buildings wrapped around a pristine playground. I didn’t realize it then, but we already had one foot out of Eden and the other edging into Bosch’s _Garden of Earthly Delights_. In retrospect, twice-weekly services at a gleaming chapel were less about devotion and more about overcompensation.\n\nWe soon traded the megachurch for a modest Latin-American Catholic parish, where we were the lone Asian family and more crucially, the only ones who couldn’t speak Spanish. I just shrugged and raced with the other kids; God had no language barrier. But my parents saw only the Tower of Babel and balked. The language gap soon grew into an excuse to slip out of church life altogether.\n\n# Book Two: Job\n\n>  _“I cry to you for help and you do not answer me; I stand, and you only look at me.” Job 30:20_\n\n#####  **Age: 10 - Prayers**\n\nA dinner plate smashed against the tile, rice splayed across the floor. My parents were fighting again. According to the Bible, I just needed to pray every night for help, and help will come. So I kneeled by my bed, hands tight in prayer. _Are you there God? It’s me, Lily._ Margaret had asked, and her parents stopped shouting.\n\nBut my parents never stopped. And my father kept breaking every object in sight—mom’s cooking, the air conditioner, a clothes hanging dryer. On my birthday, he destroyed my brand-new bicycle that I’d excitedly picked out the day before. When objects ran out, the beatings began.\n\nI prayed harder, but nothing came back. I was no Margaret. And I was no Job, rewarded two-fold for unwavering faith. I realized that if I’d been cast into Hell, then I must be wicked. I didn’t beg to uneat the fruit of knowledge. Instead, I concluded that for evil children like me, birthdays weren’t real and God wasn’t real. In God’s absence came a voice telling me to kill myself. That voice stayed with me for over twenty years. And to this day, I can’t stand my birthday.\n\n#####  **Age: 14 - Debate**\n\nIn the early 2000s, Christian Conservatives wielded ironclad power. A Constitutional ban on gay marriage was in the cards, and members of the Bush administration branded _Harry Potter_ as witchcraft. But in a parallel universe called the Internet, New Atheism was a swelling spring tide, a backlash that echoed like my own hollowed out faith. I didn’t own a computer yet, but I could feel the undertow of that other world, churning with heretics and arguments I had yet to understand. The day I got my own laptop for debate, the current claimed me. I slipped into the stream and atheism swept me away.\n\nIn the flesh I was still the odd kid out, so I fought on AIM and Gchat. There I unleashed torrents of Facts and Logic like a baby Ben Shapiro; Science(™) was my new holy book. I laughed at Pascal’s Wager, clearly a rigged gamble—because even if he won his wager, God would never honor it. After all, the Problem of Evil is simple: if God exists then He must be evil, or else He is incompetent. Why else would He let so many children suffer? My sparring partners were Asian Christians, so I’d also lambast the colonial nature of Christianity. “Religion is the opium of the people,” I’d say, quoting Karl Marx. “And Chinese people were literally destroyed by opium! How could you side with our oppressors?” Unsurprisingly, my chat windows grew quiet as we drifted apart.\n\nI had just one friend who also stopped believing in God. I was eager to chat with him about why. But Ryan said he stopped believing because he prayed for his crush Brittany to like him back, and it didn’t happen. _What a stupid reason to lose faith_. I told him he should keep believing.\n\n#####  **Age: 18 - Yearbook**\n\nEven without the God debate, my best male friend and I were destined to split like the Red Sea, leaving him on solid shore, me to drown in the waves. Tom was everything I wasn’t: wealthy, sophisticated, and gratingly popular—the lone cool Asian kid. No miracle arose to bridge us; after freshman year, we hardly spoke again. Yet on the last day of school, he found my yearbook and scrawled a somber note into a corner: _You were right, God does not exist_. For someone who hated God, this victory strangely struck me like a gut punch.\n\n# Book Three: Ecclesiastes\n\n>  _“For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven.” Ecclesiastes 3:1_\n\n#####  **Age: 19 - Violence**\n\nOn the microblogging platform Tumblr, I found my revolution. There I also found Jamila, a razor-tongued, atheist Palestinian-Venezuelan; quite a cursed ethnic combo. She served searing blasphemy while I blogged Nietzsche/Lana del Rey _(“God’s dead, I said baby, that’s alright with me.”)._ But soon, our teenage rage was directed away from religion and towards more worthy scapegoats: white supremacy, patriarchy, and capitalism.\n\nThrough Tumblr, I surfaced the full splendor of Marx’s quote that I’d once mangled: \n\n> “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.” \n\nOpium, I learned, was medicine in Marx’s day—he used it to soothe the pain from his skin lesions. Faith was not poison, but poultice for the suffering masses. And faith, tempered by righteous rebellion, could forge itself into a spear against tyranny. No figure better captured gospel-turned-guillotine than John Brown, the devout Christian who slashed slavers to pieces under God’s banner. When John was caught and sentenced to death, Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked, “He will make the gallows glorious like the Cross.” For the first time, I found myself admiring the sharpness of faith; Jesus taught us to turn the other cheek, but John Brown taught us to slice it.\n\n#####  **Age: 20 - Steps**\n\nSuicidal ideation had kicked me out of college freshman year. Nearly twelve months later I returned, running on Escitalopram. The pills sanded every edge; I felt nothing, good or bad. Being zombified helped get the ball of life rolling again, even though I was just shuffling through the motions. I was only barely, technically alive.\n\nOne day, I was descending the stairs of the Honors college when a great presence struck me with lightning precision. I froze on the steps. Time dilated; terror and wonder braided together and poured through me. SSRIs can shoot chilly electrical tingles called “brain zaps” as a side effect, but this surge felt different. It wasn’t numbing static, but warm and radiant. Effused in golden light, I was almost certain it was God speaking to me.\n\n#####  **Age: 24 - Iceland**\n\nSummer 2017 was post-Master’s graduation, pre-full time job in Silicon Valley, and a spiritual reckoning. In Edinburgh, fueled on a whim from the fading afterglow of MDMA, I booked the cheapest ticket to Reykjavik. Each day serendipity was my travel guide. On the first day, a gay Brazilian fashion photographer and I started chatting while steeping in the Blue Lagoon hot springs. On the second day, we parked at a small town off Route 1 to photograph a stunning church. A sermon was in progress, so we slipped quietly into the back pew. I closed my eyes.\n\nThe priest’s lolling tones sent me into a trance; I lost all sense of time. I swore I could understand the sermon, as though the Icelandic words dissolved and reformed as pure meaning, ringing in my mind. _An effect of the MDMA?_ , I thought. After the last amen, I turned to my equally dazed Brazilian friend. He asked if I could understand the sermon. “It seemed like the priest was speaking in English,” he murmured.\n\n#####  **Age: 25 - Stanford**\n\nI hadn’t set foot at Stanford since leaving Fremont, and all I recalled was its ocean of green. Now back in the Bay for work, I often strode through those lush grounds whenever I needed some soul oxygen. One afternoon, I stepped out of Cantor Arts Center and saw an old ghost. Tom. My former friend.\n\nWe hadn’t spoken in seven years. He’d chosen Stanford; I stayed in Arizona. I called his name and he raised a sheepish hand. We traded small talk and penciled in a proper catch up in San Francisco. His yearbook message played on loop in my mind. Surely this was divine providence, handing me a chance to admit _sorry, actually I was wrong_.\n\nBut when I texted to confirm coffee plans, he ghosted me. I told myself it’s okay; I would also ignore some silly girl who helped lead me astray from God.\n\n#####  **Age: 28 - Discord**\n\nBy now Jamila and I had logged a decade of friendship. We had long abandoned public Tumblr banters for private Discord DMs. When Silicon Valley coincidentally brought us together, we also laughed at our former antics while walking through Redwood City. We’d both come a long way from our keyboard crusader days.\n\nOne night while DM’ing about Ayaan Hirsi Ali, she tossed off that it was stupid anyone still believed in religion. Ayaan had been mutilated in the name of Islam; no sane person should defend such institutions. My cursor blinked for a beat before I hit the thumbs up emoji. I didn’t fear this emerging discord between us. I just no longer cared to debate God.\n\n# Book Four: Psalms\n\n>  _“He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.” Psalms 40:2_\n\n#####  **Age: 29 - Joshua Tree**\n\nJanuary 2021—a full year into COVID-19—rendered even I, a perennial introvert, completely touch-starved. When some friends booked an Airbnb at Joshua Tree for a weekend, I practically vaulted into my car to see them. By day, we laughed at the Teddy bear cacti and by night, roasted s’mores under desert stars. It was over too quickly, and sadly, I never hung out with those friends again. The pandemic had scattered us for good. Still, at least I had the wilderness, my cathedral without ceilings.\n\nAt 5 a.m. I began what should have been a simple four-hour drive back to Phoenix. An hour in, the sunrise dyed the sky so beautifully that I veered into the sand to admire the view, missing signs declaring _WARNING: SOFT SHOULDERS_. When I tried re-entering the road, my tires spun and spun. One bar of reception winked in and out; no other cars were in sight. Even in my best case, the nearest tow truck would cost a small fortune and a long wait.\n\nI’d barely begun to berate myself when a gray van appeared on the empty road. _Great, a witness to my stupidity. But maybe they’ll let me use their phone._ The van braked near me, its driver leaning out his window. “Stuck?” I confirm yes. To my astonishment, six Marines piled out with ropes, hooks, and traction pads. With pads beneath my wheels, a tow-strap between bumpers, gentle taps on the gas, and six pairs of arms against the trunk, my car climbed out of its forlorn ditch in five minutes.\n\n“God is a nice idea,” Judy Blume writes. “He belongs to everybody.” I recall the Fremont church ladies with their potluck dishes, and years later, the Marines with their roadside rescue. God in every bandage, every ladle, every rope. _Semper Fidelis_ —Always Faithful, the Corps official motto—had been drilled into those Devil Dogs for years, ready to be loaned out to any stranded, faithless soul. \n\nWhen I got home, I wrote in my journal that God was real.\n***"}]}

When I flew to my hometown in April, I had just two expectations: see my sick 90-year-old grandpa and treat my pre-cervical cancer. And honestly, I prioritized the novel treatment over tepid bonds with my relatives. For me, family is a river reflecting shame. The shame ran so deep that I almost canceled the trip—cancer care be damned. But fear of death made me channel _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_ , so __ I bought the ticket and took the ride. In contrast to Thompson's drug-addled escape from a dying American dream, I meant for my ride to be repressed and resigned. I was a body on autopilot, searching for a cure that would, in the most literal sense, save my life. Instead, I found feeling, a soul stirring. A pulse thawed from permafrost. Real, life-saving, erotic energy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Shame as a cold river\n\nI last stood in Sichuan nine years ago, staring at the ancient Dujiangyan irrigation system, meditating on shame. Over two thousand years ago, engineers forked the wild Min river with a levee instead of a dam. One branch swallows the floods, the other feeds over 2,000 square miles of fertile fields to this day. Water is to life as _saving face_ is to Chinese culture. An alien concept to Westerners, _face_ refers to social status cultivated through virtue and achievement, not just for yourself, but for your family and friends. Face is a collective reservoir, easily drained. A child’s good job refills the cistern; a moral lapse cracks the embankment for everyone. When the reservoir bursts, its runoff surges into my river. Lose face, be flooded with shame. As the tide rose inside me, I texted a friend “Being Chinese kinda sucks,” then boarded my flight. I was never good at treading water.\n\nThis trip forced me upriver, to the roaring headwater where my shame was born: money. Its absence ripped me away from bonding with family; I saw my relatives just three times in thirty years. Its absence powered abuse at home, leaving bruises in its backwash. Its absence stranded us to low, muddy banks while our wealthier Chinese-American acquaintances enjoyed deeper waters. As an adult, I still ferry my destitute, divorced mom across the shallows, pretending we’re cruising on the American dream. Some say even the poorest can save face through virtue alone, but I’ve only ever seen it be pay-to-play. In China, my mom and I played rich enough; it’s easy to do with exchange rates. We rigged rafts out of lies: my abusive father is “a wonderful husband” and “we visit him in Silicon Valley” and “we still live in that big house.” Among her rich retiree friends and family drawing 10,000+ RMB per month, my minimum-wage mom still managed to stay buoyant. She is quintessentially Chinese in a way that I’m not. For her, keeping up appearances is social glue, not deceit. Layer by layer, she collects the silt of status, securing her shoreline. I drift beside her, half-drowned.\n\nClass pretense may have worked, but moral, sexual shame lapped at my heels. I arrived with HPV, no ring, no man—a _sheng nu_ , a leftover woman. My aunt whispered “It’s okay you’re still single,” which proved it wasn’t. I kept up the saccharine smiles until I was blocked from treatment. What a wasted trip. I threw a fit, scaring my uncle, then hid in my bathroom where the math decor on shower walls mocked me. They reminded me of my ex, who loved tracing equations onto fogged panes. He was haunting me in China, a spectre from a past where I had face, a “high-value man,” a mask for bisexuality. Before him, short-lived situationships with women spared me from reenacting S _aving Face (2004)_. In the movie, Chinese lesbian Wil tries coming out: “Ma. I love you. And I'm gay.” Her mom responds: “How can you say those two things at once?...I am not a bad mother. My daughter is not gay.” My mom would add: “You still like men? Then choose a man!” Flawless logic. My family doesn’t think “the bisexuals are gonna kill me,” but they do see gayness as a stain that shame should scrub off. Used as a temporary tool, shame _can_ nudge people back in social line. Too bad homosexuality is permanent.\n\nSince shame needs witnesses, it arrives hot; a public scalding. But once it seeps in, you become your own witness, your own warden. The heat leaks away. When the reservoir broke, class failure rushed out first, sinking the little pride I had. Lesser streams of shame—sexual or otherwise—poured into the river and sank me lower. In time, my river went glacial. Shame froze me over the years, damming up all other emotions, submerging them under its slow-sinking, twisting nausea, folding me inwards, away from the prying, judging gaze of others and towards the harshest, most unforgiving gaze of all: my own. I recoiled from being Chinese. It burned like flesh on dry ice. These old waters had turned my idea of China into something broken, into a wasteland of lack and lies. So I self-exiled from my heritage. It didn’t help much though. No matter how far I roamed, the ice still found me, carving fresh channels into the next brittle foothold I tried to claim. But I didn’t need to out-swim or bottle it up. I needed Dujiangyan at the source, a levee to divert the creeping shame before it could swallow all life downstream. \n\n### The erotic as Dujiangyan\n\nThe last time I saw her thirteen years ago, we were just friends, kids in Xi’an complaining about the worst food of our lives, unaware that our paths would cross in a different way. She’s the daughter of my mom’s rich best friend. Even back then, she seemed gay. I clocked Kristen Stewart in 2012, so my gaydar is pretty good. And according to my mom’s best friend, her daughter isn’t dating because “men are trash”, which sounds like a lesbian thing to say. But she could be saving face with her mom. Or maybe she’s out to her mom, and her mom is saving face with my mom. We left it as subtext while forming plans around Yulin. My nerves swelled at the thought of seeing her again. \n\nThe first time I saw her on this trip, I was probably already a goner. She surfaced from the metro like some suave C-pop boy band member, self-possessed in a way I could only dream of being. Perhaps wealth always walks like that. I admired her masculine silhouette, a studied boyish beauty. She looked like someone who sketches poetic notes in the margins of books. My nerves settled the longer we talked. Our moms drifted away while she bought me a matcha, her voice the same sweet tone I remembered. I followed the delicate gestures of her hands, her tired eyes. I joked she was a victim of 996 work culture, and she laughed, a lilting, earnest sound. She asked about my hobbies and I confessed to writing, something I never disclose. She lit up; she reads a lot. We discussed _The Three Body Problem_ —she graciously asked if I’d read it in Chinese, then praised my Mandarin anyway without patronizing me, unlike my uncle. Over dinner, we laughed at the torrent of Luigi Mangione posts on Red Note. “He really is too handsome,” she sighed. _Shit, maybe she’s straight?_ My worry vanished when she suggested dinner, just us. We swapped WeChat profiles to set a plan.\n\nShe’d chosen an English name: Mars. Her Chinese name was _stars_. Fitting.\n\n*\n\nThe second time I saw her on this trip, my stomach lurched. She wore the same weary coolness on her face. When she turned her head and the gray metro lights skimmed across her short hair like sunlight on water, I was really, truly _gone_. A dam cracked open inside me—not polite interest, not admiration, but hunger. It tore through me. I pictured sliding my fingers through her hair. I wanted to press my lips to her shuttered, exhausted eyes. I imagined tracing a thumb along the uneven edges of her crooked bottom teeth. I dreamed of pinning her against the wall of some Chengdu nightclub, sealing her mouth with mine, feeling her laughs and shudders breaking over me until morning light.\n\nA smidge of guilt seeped in, a familiar feeling from old waters, whispering that I was betraying my ex. A fresh new tide rose against the it, a surge of wonder at feeling this way again about someone new. It happens only every few years, so I’d forgotten the rush, the aliveness, the spring flower bursting through frost after a long winter. I recalled that my ex dreamed of exploring Mars someday. I never wanted to leave the sanctity of Earth for the quiet horror of space. But suddenly __ I was interested in life on Mars alright.\n\nWhatever electric current I felt stayed unmoored; I never confirmed she was even gay. My mom cuntblocked me, tagging along since I’d be kidnapped taking the metro alone. All I managed for our “date” was a clumsy attempt to pay for Mars’ food, which I failed at by scanning the menu instead of the payment app. It’s what happens when you try to impress your crush in front of your mom. But there were small benefits to my mom’s presence. She snapped photos of us. And while the two of them chatted, I listened dreamily, letting Mars’ voice wash over me. She kept referring to me as _jie_ —big sister—and I nearly asked her to stop, lest I develop an unfortunate psychosexual complex. But I kept quiet and drank her presence in. \n\n“What a shame that she looks like a boy,” my mom said when we returned home.\n\nWell, isn’t everything a fucking shame?\n\n _“We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark—that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.\"_\n\n—Hunter S. Thompson, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\n\nI thought the wave had long broken for me. That the high-water mark had come and gone, before I was even born. That shame was all I’d inherited. But this time, something surged and I was drowning in delirium, a most welcome little death. After my failed outing, my mom and I met Mars’ mom for hot pot. Maybe she could read the _I-wanna-fuck-your-daughter_ vibe from my face, because she shot me a knowing look and twice scolded my mom for crashing our night out: “They had young adult things to discuss in private!” From that single wink of hope, I let fantasy bloom. Over the next month, I replayed each syllable in riveting, drooling detail. I pored over our photos religiously. I downloaded Pleco and binged YouTube videos titled _What It’s Like to Be Gay in China (For Intermediate Chinese Learners)_. I endured podcasts about the boring tariffs just to pick up business-grade Mandarin. I dreamed about a life together in my hometown, our two streams intertwining. Small devotions to a god-star of a girl.\n\nAnd then I crashed back to earth, sober yet enlightened. Limerence has such a thin atmosphere. Even if she felt the same way, we are different planets. Different worlds. Different classes. Different languages, orbiting at different speeds. Mars was never a real destination. She’s a projection, an escape hatch. And I’m no astronaut, just a tourist in a rented rocket. Reality has a heavier gravity, and I relish its pull as I descend into a landscape redrawn, a sky rearranged. This was never a mission about getting the girl. This is about eroticism. A return of want, desire as vivid spring rain, droplets dancing on the surface of a melting river. Now I can feel constellations falling from skies above. So I don’t message her. I don’t need to. I fall—for her, through her—into a wordless and warm river, nothing like the icebound shame that once suffused me. The erotic is not “sensation without feeling,” but feeling so true it refuses to be reasoned with, charted, or proofed. I am Walt Whitman leaving the astronomer’s lecture hall, standing alone in the mystical moist night-air. No longer calculating, but looking up at the night sky. Looking at Mars, my modern myth. My star, my perfect silence.\n\nI left China with a strange cure: the return of want itself. And that’s my Dujiangyan, the erotic charge of life humming in my blood, diverting the river of shame. I only know now in the glow of this new warmth what liveliness I’d been missing. Unreasoning desire cracked the ice and outpoured a great wellspring. Strange that I cannot fathom it now, being dammed up again by that old shame. I have trouble recalling the feeling of smallness, of exposure, of running away from myself, so lush is this new flowing feeling, this spring in my step. No amount of books or talk therapy or late-night journaling could have unlocked this in me. I needed to remember that I’m allowed to want, not merely be some servile creature at an altar I never believed in. And now it’s back, the simple, stupid, gorgeous pleasure of wanting itself. Now I’m aware of new fertile fields sprouting new sounds: _I like being Chinese. I like myself. I want to be me. I want to become._\n***"}]}

Shame on you!\"_\n\nDo you know that the original photo inspired the same outrage at first? Richard Drew and his photo _The Falling Man_ were \"denounced as coldblooded, ghoulish and sadistic.\" Even as _The Falling Man_ was harshly criticized, Richard Drew remained steadfast. \n\n> \"I didn't capture this person's death,\" he explains. \"I captured part of his life.\"\n\nToday _The Falling Man_ is known as an artistic masterpiece and \"one of the most perfect photographs ever taken.\" \n\nHistory doesn't repeat; it rhymes.\n\nI bought the \"Falling Man\" NFT because it seized me. I'm moved by its history and what I've discovered about trauma, healing, choice, and identity by exploring this controversy. I'm moved by its future and our future. I'm moved by free speech. When I say free speech, I don't mean in the legal sense. Absent government coercion, @GameStopNFT has the right to remove \"Falling Man\" NFT. \n\nFree speech challenges the lines we draw around what we're allowed to witness. Free speech tests the boundaries of self-censorship.\n\nI'll say more on free speech later. First, I have a confession to make. \n\nBefore this NFT, I had never seen the original _The Falling Man_ photo. \n\nYes, really. I'm an American who has never reckoned with 9/11, until now.\n\nAside from that day where I sat in a classroom, too young to understand the living horror playing out on TV, I've managed to avoid all news related to 9/11. News is propaganda, so I don't consume news. It's one way I protect myself from being manipulated.\n\nNaturally, I missed the news cycle around the \"Falling Man\" NFT. When I learned about it, the NFT was already delisted. And Jules, the first artist I've ever bought an NFT from and who I talked to in private, had gone mute. I wrote about buying from Jules here.\n\nSo when I looked at the \"Falling Man\" NFT, I saw it with fresh eyes. It transported me to a terrible moment: Ad Astra in theaters, 2019. Brad Pitt played Roy McBride, an astronaut sent to the outskirts of our Solar System in search of a father who doesn't love him.\n\nAd Astra triggered such extreme disassociation in me that when I stumbled into the theater bathroom, I couldn't recognize myself in the mirror. My consciousness fled to the backseat of my body. Sounds were blunted. My skin was numb. I felt nothing. I was alone.\n\nThat's what trauma does. It makes you feel isolated. You become your own afterimage, a shadow of the You from Before. Like the original photo, the \"Falling Man\" NFT dances with this familiar shadow. The disorientation, the terror of freefall—it's a haunting image.\n\nBut it didn't only recall trauma for me. I also saw the grace and stillness, the same quietness that so arrested photo editor Naomi Halperin when she viewed the original. The Associated Press ran 170,000 copies of _The Falling Man_ in large print on The Morning Call, one day after 9/11.\n\nThe fury was immediate. People wrote that it was \"stomach punching,\" \"obscene,\" \"taking away the person's humanity,\" \"used in poor judgment.\" _Do not let your children read this paper_ , they said. \n\nAnd no news organization ever ran it in mass again.\n\nFrom this documentary, I learned that _The Falling Man_ inspired more responses than any photo in news organizations' history. In the same breath, it was erased from cultural memory. With it, the ~200 people who jumped from The Twin Towers were also forgotten.\n\nThey were forgotten because their deaths were imperfect. \"No one jumped. We don't say that,\" NY coroners offices said to journalist Tom Junod. \"They were forced.\" \n\nThe possibility of choice was too terrible to consider.\n\n> Some people who look at the picture see stoicism, willpower, a portrait of resignation; others see something else—something discordant and therefore terrible: freedom.\n\nSo Americans resisted _The Falling Man_. We wanted our heroes instead, like these firefighters in Raising the Flag at Ground Zero by Tom Franklin. They are a much easier narrative to bear.\n\nYet some who lost their loved ones on 9/11 found comfort in the evidence that they may have jumped from The Twin Towers.\n\nJack Gentul says of his wife Alayne: \n\n> \"It might just be the last element of control that you have. Everything around you is happening and you can't stop it, but this is something you can do. And to be out of the smoke and heat and be out in the air, it must have felt like flying.\"\n\nRichard Pecorella, who lost his fiancé Karen Juday, thinks it was brave of her to jump from The Twin Towers. It became an obsession for him, pouring over the photographs of those who jumped. \n\nHe thinks he found her in a snapshot. \n\n> \"I would know her from her shadow.\"\n\nHer death was no longer painful for Richard because he finally had something of hers to hold onto. \"Not knowing how I lost her is more painful,\" he confirms in the documentary.\n\nStill others fiercely rejected the idea that their loved one jumped. In his quest to identify and honor _The Falling Man_ , journalist Cheney Drive landed on Norberto Hernandez, a pastry chef at Windows. He ran the full story at The Globe in 2001.\n\nBut if Norberto was the man in the photo, that meant he may have committed suicide. His family could not accept that his soul was damned forever. \"Please clear my husband's name,\" pleas Eulogia Hernandez to Tom Junod.\n\nIn his investigation, Junod thought _The Falling Man_ might be Jonathan Briley, a sound engineer at Windows. The documentary describes Jonathan as \"always smiling\" with \"a bounce in his step.\" \n\n> \"He was a special person who gave a piece of himself to each in his family.\"\n\nIn his essay, Junod lays out the case for the identity of _The Falling Man_. His ultimate conclusion? It doesn't matter who _The Falling Man_ is. \n\nGwendolyn Briley, Jonathan Briley's sister, tells Junod that _The Falling Man_ is beyond a single individual. \n\n> \"The photo's so much bigger than any man, because the man in the photo is clearly in God's hands. And it's God who gives us the grace to go on.\"\n\n _The Falling Man_ is meaningful because he is unidentified. He lays in the Tomb of the Unknown, a man who stands in for all. He could be any of us. When we see the photo, we ask ourselves—would I jump? Do I even have a choice?\n\nThrough _The Falling Man_ , we wrestle with our \"own feelings about mortality.\"\n\nThrough _The Falling Man_ , I wrestle with being American too. I'm an immigrant from a country that has long-standing political tension with the U.S. Immigrants exist in a liminal space between the motherland and America. Sometimes we have to choose.\n\nI was too young to be rallied by the collective trauma of 9/11. I didn't raise the flag and emerge American from a cocoon of grief and rage. By the time I was old enough to understand, I saw only how ineffective our vengeful patriotism turned out to be.\n\nWe tarred all dissenters, like Representative Barbara Lee, as anti-American terrorists. We ushered in an era of mass surveillance under the guise of safety. We peddled the lie of WMDs; over a million Iraqis paid the price with their lives.\n\nFor long time, I was not proud to be an American. I took on shame, made it all my responsibility. I did the opposite of what Richard Drew describes below: I looked at pictures of death caused by America and empathized with the victims, for they were all my victims.\n\nI dived into leftwing politics. I critiqued American foreign policy. I saw only the bad, the ugly, the cruel. \"Why should I care about 9/11 when we rained destruction to the world a hundredfold?\" I asked. What I was really doing was running from myself.\n\nI was intellectualizing and politicizing a different question. This question was not really a question at all, but a trauma-born, core self-belief. It sounded like this: \"Why should I care about my pain, when so many people suffer more, when they suffer because of me?\"\n\nOver time the belief faded, whether it was because of age or trauma therapy or my choice to leave politics. I stopped burdening myself with shame that wasn't mine. I don't mind being American anymore, because I'm proud to be me. I'm proud to be an American.\n\nAmerica is the greatest nation on Earth, in every sense of the word. \n\nShe is a beautiful experiment, a democratic republic where all are created equal. \n\nShe is a ruthless empire, a war machine that is never satiated. \n\nThese two realities can contradict and coexist.\n\nI had to make peace with another contradiction this week. I avoided 9/11 because of the propaganda, yes. But I was erasing even the human parts, choosing not to acknowledge that propaganda can contain truth. I was self-censoring.\n\nSo I read these articles, watched my first 9/11 documentary. I cried for these people. And I wrote about them, how they've transformed me. I wrote after 15 years of believing I couldn't write. All this because an artist spoke outside the lines and turned us into witnesses.\n\nI wonder what Jules has to say. In my chats with them, I sensed they were a gentle soul. They were excited and humbled that their art became so popular. A week later, all the love bestowed upon Jules burned to ashes. The crowd giveth, the crowd taketh away.\n\nWhat I do know is that Jules augments their art with AI tools. Did Jules type the search term \"falling man\" into DALL-E 2, which spit out a nightmare from our collective dreams? Did Jules even recognize the iconic image generated by the AI?\n\nOr did Jules purposefully choose the original photo as some kind of social commentary? Did they: \n\n  * relish in negative attention? \n\n  * enjoy pushing boundaries?\n\n  * delight in the macabre? \n\nI doubt it. But even if this were true, I would support their art.\n\nAs Richard Drew says of _The Falling Man_ photo, \"It is not up to him to reject the images that fill his frame, because one never knows when history is made until one makes it.\"\n\nAnd if the \"Falling Man\" NFT was a primarily AI driven creation, could we still imbue it with social commentary? Is there an exploitative, tasteless and cruel ghost in the machine? Or is this a new consciousness handing us a warning, a premonition of our future?\n\nWill we colonize the universe and cheer when Martian George W. Bush laughs with Venutian Ellen DeGeneres while Pluto burns? Will we channel our algorithmic anger at a powerless artist whose crime was to depict a crime scene?\n\nWill we disappear into the metaverse, seeking real connection but too afraid of transgression to truly connect, and slip into a soma induced haze of bits and bytes? Will we ever heal our collective pain without weaponizing it to manipulate and maim?\n\nI'm an optimist and an artist. We can. We can because you're reading this, because I changed when I wrote this, because I was compelled to write, as if pen and ink and hand were possessed. We can because this searing moment where technology and art collided is history.\n\nI know technology, and I can try to define art. Art can be beautiful. But it can also be grotesque (Goya), debauched (Marquis de Sade), mischievous (Duchamp). Great art should unmoor you. Great artists are like astronauts—at the frontier, limitless.\n\nBoth versions of _The Falling Man_ unmoored me. They disturbed me, shocked me, mesmerized me. They drew tears from unknown, deeper parts of my well. I hurtled back to 2019, when I was alone and trapped by trauma. I felt like no one else in the universe could understand me.\n\n _The Falling Man_ seemed alone in the universe too, as described by Tom Junod: \n\n> \"There was something everyday about him, and something forever remote about him. How could you possibly ever get to that experience?\"\n\n2019 me would say: I can't get to that experience, that's why I don't deserve to feel pain. I am lonely, but real loneliness is _The Falling Man_ , that's why I don't deserve to feel alone. I want to die, but _The Falling Man_ wants to live, that's why I don't deserve to live.\n\nNone of that is true. The documentary describes the jumpers going one at a time, as if they drew courage from the person who leaped before them. Today when I look at _The Falling Man_ , I know that even his terrible, remote experience was shared with others. He was not alone.\n\nHe was witnessed by the other jumpers, by Richard Drew, by the New Yorkers who could not bear to look away from hell raining down. \n\nToday, he is witnessed by AI, by Jules, by me. By you.\n\nBecause of art, the arrow of time reverses, healing the past with the present's dream of a brighter future. Because of art, I no longer believe that every living creature dies alone.\n\nI intentionally shared these artworks at the start of this essay. _The Falling Man_ demands to be looked at, not forgotten. \n\nSo take a closer look. \n\nDo you know who he is?\n\n\"He was you and me.\" \n\nIf we are to build a better future, we cannot afford to forget ourselves.\n***"}]}

My MAGA mom, for one, is out for blood. To her, the Charlie Kirk memorial is simple. Vengeance is a better breakfast than her pears and red-bean bread. Between bites, she continues cursing the left. I roll my eyes. 6:15 a.m. is too early, so I drown her out with Power by Ye on repeat; Charlie's favorite hype song, according to his work wife, Candace Owens. I nod to the lyrics: \"This is way too much, I need a moment.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Attending this memorial is also some stupid, desperate bid to please my mom. In September, I returned from New York City with zero-carb rice, a gift in answer to her gripes about rice-driven weight gain. But fifteen minutes later, she’s dressed me down to nothing. My sins: I squandered money, wasted time and energy carrying it in my suitcase, and fell for “fake liberal bullshit.” Through furious—and embarrassing—tears, I tried protesting: it was $10, I’m not _that_ weak, and stop mom, it’s literally just food. Then she yelled that nothing I give her could ever match the gift that was Charlie Kirk, which shocked me out of my sobs. _Well alright, chuck the rice into the trash. Let’s go see Charlie_. You see? I’m not some vulture, feasting for spectacle. I’m something even more pathetic, a yelping dog begging for a meager scrap. She thinks if she mewls a little more, her world will change, turn on its axis, show her bright lights, big cities, big dreams. A part of me wants a savior to put Old Yeller out to pasture. Take that thing out of its misery. Just shoot it through the neck. Je suis Charlie Kirk. If you didn’t laugh at my fucked up joke, I’m glad your mom loves you.\n\nWho even was Charlie Kirk? Let’s dissect Charlie Kirk the propagandist, which I don’t mean as an accusation. We need propaganda to survive even when it destroys us, as the prophetic French philosopher and theologian Jacques Ellul would say. Propaganda is what every media scavenger is responding to, after all. Even if you binged over 5,000 hours of Charlie Kirk content, you still wouldn’t know Charlie Kirk the man. I knew of him before his murder, though I never sampled his product. Of the right wing content creators, Candace Owens suits my appetite the most; I like my girls insane. So I get a taste of him now, consuming the way the public consumed him—piecemeal, a Rorschach hors d’oeuvre.\n\nIf you’re my mom—on the Right and not a Nick Fuentes fanatic—then Charlie was delicious. Destined for the Presidency, he was a great, honorable man who loved faith, family, and freedom. Standing in line at 7 a.m. is my mom multiplied by the thousands. Classic Republican physiognomies as far as the eye can see, bottled blondes carrying heels around like it’s prom night. Some guy shouts back at their loud woos “We are all Charlie Kirk!” to chittering applause. A high-spirited atmosphere, no mourning. Perhaps everyone, sans my mom, is in a forgiving mood? This surprises me, though it shouldn’t have. Turning Point, the organization that Charlie founded in 2012, asked for our red, white, or blue Sunday best, not black. My mom and I donned flowing white dresses, but most of the crowd wore shirts with words like _BLOOD OF CHRIST_. Merch made in communist China, no doubt. The deprecating dog in me wants to mock a little more, but faith tastes so sweetly sincere that I swallow my tongue.\n\nNow if you’re on the far Right or far Left, then you’re united: Charlie Kirk was bad eating. To a groyper, Charlie was overcooked establishment meat, a rubbery Israel First steak instead of medium rare America First. If you’re a Leftist, then he was unforgivable. A fascist Nazi, or in less charged terms, a “hate-mongerer” as Ta-Nehisi Coates retorted in response to Ezra Klein’s controversial statement that Charlie was “practicing politics the right way,” referencing Charlie’s devotion to debating college students. Good eating for Charlie.\n\nHaving competed in four years of switch-side debate, judged for a few years, and practiced at being an argumentative asshole to this very day, I qualify as something of a chronic master debater myself. I’ve long-digested the structure of debate. More importantly, I know what it takes to prep the counter-argument properly, to season and serve it hot enough to win. Every tournament requires equal rounds of affirming and negating, and you cannot get away with sophistry. So bluntly, Charlie Kirk was no paragon of real debate. He gestured at dialogue, plating up polite politics like empty fine dining: all presentation, no substance. Competent, charismatic, confident content, but propagandistic content at its core, an endless churn made for quick hits, not satiation. Propaganda is beyond lies, beyond persuasion—it predigests reality for people to swallow whole without question. And Charlie Kirk in debate drag was fluent in the technique, spoon-feeding a MAGA-only palate to the youth. But hey, I’m just some dog with all bark and no bite. Charlie was a Michelin-starred propaganda chef, a generational talent surpassing even the likes of AOC and Mamdani. And stripped to the bones, Charlie was no different from you or I. He was seeking answers in a complex world, a world where we cannot reliably distinguish data from propaganda. So we’re asked to simplify, to commune with easy answers and easy blame, marking scapegoats as the source of all strife. Propaganda serves victors and victims of us all, even its most loyal purveyors. Now one of its greatest victors has reaped the spoils, laid out on the table to be picked clean.\n\nAnd I daresay Charlie Kirk, dead, is even riper for the picking than Charlie Kirk, alive. If Jacques Ellul lived to see his public execution, he would say the algorithm is the greatest propagandist of all, a mechanical black priest with a singular virtue: attention. It crowns what best captures our eyes, even a snuff film. It baptizes fear, shock, disgust, making us gag out of reflex even as we lick our screens clean, begging for more horror. Even though I’d avoided Charlie’s graphic murder, I’m still a 21st-century schizoid like you. I found out just last week that I suffered food poisoning in the aftermath, sickened from false propaganda that he was shot in front of his family. Who spread that lie? Who benefitted from spreading that lie? Perhaps you’re tempted to blame specific people, groups, foreign adversaries, as I am. But from a bird’s eye view, it’s the machine. It’s the machine that churns out Charlie’s death, the machine that turns even my 5 ft 4 mom into a Dragon Lady fit to kill. We haven’t descended into 4chan or Kiwi Farms or Live Leak; we’ve given the beasts escape velocity from quarantine. And there’s no unringing this bell. Hell is empty, and all the devils are here.\n\nI briefly chew on Charlie Kirk the man, a person behind the propaganda. You want to know what I think of him so you can judge me, deem me worthy or unforgivable for rightthink or wrongthink. Well, tough luck. I don’t have your appetite. Better to eat a mirror and digest my own penchant for spite, hatred, dishonesty, since “the line separating good and evil passes…through every human heart.” I can be quite the frothing mad dog, after all. So partisans, please stay mad at this paradox: Charlie was good and hateful, like me. He was a sinner, like me. Now he has returned to the arms of his Maker, and if judgment went well, lives in a place where there is no more death and no more suffering. Meanwhile, I get to suffer a whole life ahead of me; I’m aimless and alone, just one year older than Charlie. Charlie, with a whole wife and two kids and a sprawling conservative empire. Charlie, eternally 31.\n\nI think about belonging as we squeeze in like sardines by 10:20 a.m after breaking through a dogshit line secured by the bottom quartile of TSA agents. My mom leaves to buy $25 pizza, insisting that I eat. I remind her that I’ve water-fasted for over a week before, so half a day abstaining is nothing. But no, she won’t have it. For a moment I imagine trashing the pizza like the rice. I’m starving, but not for food. \n\nThen the Christian music swells and I’m lost in discomfort. Physically, that is. I’m seated too close to the stage, where sound turns to pressure turns to rattling in my ribcage. People of my cultural milieu, the ones who grow up and out of church and into atheism or soft agnostic faithless faith, or the ones who had no faith in the first place, likely can’t relate to this strange spectacle, this alien set of Evangelical symbology. But I remember how good it felt to spread my own alien mythos on Tumblr as a teenager, that secular religion called woke left propaganda. How good it felt to blame the source of all evil on straight white male supremacy, to belong for the first time in my life to something larger, grandiose, visionary. The hunger for belonging never dies; it just changes gods.\n\nBack then, if I had a real family, I never would’ve found a false family in the deep dark recesses of cult-like subculture. I fled that gruesome pack, eventually crawling back to the largest, most infinite presence. So if the gospels are propaganda, then let me swallow them whole. Suffuse me, string me out on love. Unlike my time on Tumblr, I don’t feel good here; there’s no easy belonging. I’m a stranger in a strange land, crying out for the God of the Lost to save me. Yet the alien is comforting, easy to sway to. I don’t know the words to the gospel songs, but I raise my hand in Hallelujah. I find myself tearing up, praying, asking for help. When I look up at the morose gray light cracking through the stadium beams, I think _maybe yeah, I can see God._\n\nThe mysticism of the music stays through speeches by Charlie’s friends. My mom returns with pizza; I eat a slice as I eat their words, chuckling through tears as Stacy Sheridan ribs on Charlie’s high-pitched laugh. I don’t doubt she loved him. Yet my mom, who feeds the dog and then calls it fat later, leaves me cold and suspicious. Probably because her theatrics are quite mean-spirited. On the other hand, the WWE theatrics here are good-natured. All these sparklers and gameshow contestant walkouts make me think Charlie Kirk Day could be a yearly carnival, a cheery 9/10 to prequel a somber 9/11. \n\nMy tears dry quickly once the overtly propagandistic, political pundits rear their heads. I relish Tucker Carlson’s pterodactyl cackle and wonder why a Hindu like Tulsi Gabbard keeps invoking God. When RFK Jr. starts speaking, my mom turns to me looking like she’s been sucking for hours on a particularly sour and rancid lemon. Amazingly, she’s never heard him talk until now, his rickety voice scratching her eardrums through the speakers. That’s like taking all twenty vaccines on the CDC schedule at once. “Why’s he like that?” she whispers miserably to me. I tell her he has a condition. “If he didn’t have that voice, he could be President,” she says, shaking her head. Astute analysis about the little known Kennedy family, you heard it here first. Snark aside, what strikes me about these three pundits is their heterodoxy: Tucker now the chief conservative critic of Israel and a 9/11 conspiracy theorist, Tulsi and RFK Jr. both Democrat defectors turned Republican evangelists. Do people see this political realignment? Question the whiplash? Most probably can’t, even if they want to. “Propagandas, far from canceling each other out because they are contradictory, have a cumulative effect,” wrote Ellul. “A boxer, groggy from a left hook, does not return to normal when hit by a right hook; he becomes groggier.”\n\nThe stadium inhales as Erika Kirk’s speech draws closer; will she go for love or go for hate? I can’t tell which choice the crowd prays for. Two days after her husband’s murder, Erika vowed that “the cries of this widow will be heard around the world like a battle cry.” So I hold my breath. I think she’ll light up a warpath, follow the heat still hanging in the air from Stephen Miller’s incendiary set. He had performed a passable imitation of Goebbels while my mom screeched in uproarious agreement. To him, everyone in the stadium are children of the light while all the evil is out there, ready to be vanquished. Erika’s grief could very well be gasoline. _Bare your fangs_ , I imagine her demanding. _Howl!_ The salivating dog inside me stirs. It rears its head, puzzled but wondrous at the commandment to change, to don a vicious coat, to tear out some open throats. After all, this is a dark world where “everyone seeks to be a wolf.” At nightfall, the full moon beckons us to her bed, legs open. Why not treat this tenderless night to some teeth?\n\nBut Erika Kirk refuses the night. She starts so softly; Charlie had sprouted a single gray hair; Charlie hadn’t suffered a second; Charlie had met each day to the fullest. When Erika starts sharing his passion for revitalizing faith and family, my mom bemoans “Why is she still talking? Taking too long!” Now there’s moonlight rising in me. Here’s the wolf, hackles raised, glaring at my mom. But oh, we must forgive her. She can barely understand English even after 25 years in America. I scurry away from my mom to focus on the speech. After five minutes, when Erika starts saying that Charlie wanted to save the lost boys of the West, that’s when I knew. I knew, with creeping, spine-chilling awe, that she would forgive his murderer in front of the whole world. She could call the angels down and smite her enemies, and not a soul on Earth would blame her for her rightful vengeance. Yet…yet she will do the unearthly. She will set down her heavy crown. She looks to the heavens, past those stadium beams, beseeching God. I can almost see Him touch her hand, closing that excruciating, infinite gap to forgiveness. Forgiveness! She forgives “that young man” who gunned down her husband! And the whole stadium erupts with a mania, pain and ecstasy beyond measure. Beyond lightning, beyond thunder. Whatever this is, this electricity rippling in the air, is some unknown element of the universe. The propaganda of vengeance glitches, short-circuits. Something divine has broken through. “The answer to hate is not hate. The answer…is love and always love,” Erika intones. “Love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us.” \n\nUnfortunately, I’ve no clue if the live wire in the audience burned just as bright for hatred as it did for love. My mom found me and we left before Trump’s soft launch of autism root causes and pleasant benediction towards his enemies: “I hate my opponent, and I don’t want the best for them. I’m sorry. I’m sorry Erika...I can’t stand my opponent.” I almost laugh at the black comedy, watching the livestream from the car. What did the stadium feel like when he uttered those great sucking sounds? If anyone has power that rivals God, it’s Trump. I imagine he must have rerouted the current, tuned the voltage from forgiveness back to spite. The show must go on. Love and hate. Black and white. There’s no glitz and glam without the push and pull. Turning Point wants to open more chapters, host more college campus debates in Charlie’s name. They want new episodes in new seasons post-major character death, more dog-and-pony shows disguised as dialogue. \n\nWell Turning Point and Mr. Trump, let’s have a real debate, a proper policy round. One where we have to win over judges and jury. One where we’re actually open to changing our minds. Two people per team. Erika Kirk and I on the affirmative, you on the negative. But hey, I’ll let you bring a litany of opponents against us, whatever army you want. We affirm the resolution: Forgiveness is the only path. It’s what Charlie would’ve wanted. Erika already gave the first speech, so it’s your move.\n\nTrump recedes, lets his minions dig into Christian theology and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The ghost of pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer stands up, saying forgiving too quickly is “cheap grace,” costing nothing because it demands nothing. Why shouldn’t we hear an apology first before offering premature mercy? He cites scripture: “If your brother sins, rebuke him, _and if he repents,_ forgive him.” A secular ghost floats in to back him up; Nietzsche thinks we’re laundering a pious performance. He asks us accusingly, “Are you sure your forgiveness isn’t _ressentiment_ in disguise, an act of powerlessness that tries to turn impotence into virtue?” \n\nTheir arguments are heavy with reason, but hollow of Christ. It’s my turn now. I defend Erika Kirk with my trusted friend, Jacques Ellul. Actually, she’s **not** powerless. She turned her power into nonpower, as Christ did. He had the power to save himself from tortuous death, but chose not to use it. He forgave us all on the Cross without needing anything in return. We don’t need repentance, and we don’t need retribution. To need is to surrender choice and freewill. To need is nature; to choose is faith. To choose is to be human. However! Even if we are to be animals, Christians must daily choose to be “sheep among wolves.” We are called, not to follow blindly, but to bear witness to the innocence and sacrifice of the Lamb. We choose to “accept others’ domination,” forgiving their trespasses against us just as God forgives ours. When our bodies are asked to bare its fangs, Christ asks us to unclench our jaws, to stay soft in a world of wolves. Maybe I’m a bad sheep—or no sheep at all. I’m a hungry dog who shall stay a dog. Whatever I am, I think we’re winning the round.\n\nThen a terrible opponent raises an accusing finger…my mother. My flesh and blood. Not my enemy. “You say to forgive. But how come you can’t forgive me?” she demands. And it’s true, I can’t. I might let bygones be bygones, but not all the accumulations. Not every backhand, every silent treatment, every caustic neglectful thing she has ever done. Blaming me when the neighborhood boys break my toys. Taking me to tennis, then forcing me to sit on the sidelines because I suck. Driving me to debate and audibly laughing at how stupid I sound. My mom never liked her litter much—I’m not the sweet, feminine daughter she wants. “You should’ve been born male,” she often snarls. Well, aren’t I a son of a bitch now? Dragging my own mother for filth in public, when Erika Kirk forgives the unforgivable? \n\nBut then a sudden challenger rushes in to confront Erika: Charlie Kirk the propagandist. “Politicize my murder,” he drones, eyes glazed over, echoing his final tweet. I realize with stunning clarity that this is also Charlie Kirk the man. He would’ve loved this stadium full of wolves, gospel thundering in vain. He would’ve loved the pyrotechnics and the earnest, garish gauche of it all. He would’ve loved being sanctified, canonized, consecrated, martyred—barely memorialized. I look to Erika Kirk for help. But the more I look, the more I find myself faltering, doubting. She knew Charlie best, knew the man and the propagandist. So did she really mean her forgiveness? And if she didn’t, then was it coerced? A politicized performance demanded by her of the crowd and cameras and the constant machinery of worldly faith? I’m going down a cynical path now. I wonder how false forgiveness could be engineered for virality. No longer grace, but optics. No longer nonpower, but power. Power that appears so pure that it cannot be doubted. Could the perfect form of propaganda…look like forgiveness?\n***\nAt home, I search for a dose of pure humanity, a proper eulogy to Charlie. I don’t want to think about propaganda anymore. I can’t reach inside Erika Kirk and pull out her heart, weigh it against the truth. I only know how I feel. All I want to be is a soft little sheep. All I want to feel is love. Briefly, the memorial had flashed with it. The music. Stacy Sheridan. She was the one who made fun of Charlie’s laugh, the one who eulogized him purely as a friend. I find more of that tenderness in Candace Owen’s 24 minute tribute video to Charlie. While watching it, I think, _That’s real love, right there._ And Candace, through tears in the end, said she was praying for the people who celebrated Charlie’s death. She didn’t call them disgusting or label them evil. Only offered to pray. I dig up other videos of Candace and Charlie from her social media. They’re singing and dancing backstage. They’re sitting on a bench, looking into the distance. Funny, isn’t it, that notorious propagandist Candace Owens is the one who preserved such hallowed ground. \n\nCandace Owen's photodump on social media\n\nWhen I see photos of Charlie and Candace, I don’t see propaganda—I see my old debate friends and I. Suddenly I’m traveling back in time, back to those sweet boys I was half in love with, half in awe of in high school. Those rich prep school boys with their Orthodox Christian and Catholic upbringings were generous beyond measure. They stayed up late to teach me about Foucault’s biopower, showed me the best Italo-disco remixes of trending pop songs, gently eviscerated each of my shitty arguments without an ounce of arrogance or pity. They were so beyond me, but they treated me so well. Tears flood as memories pour in. I return to my mom, who was trying to treat me well, standing for 40 minutes to buy me a pizza I didn’t want, but did eat. I didn’t savor it. Couldn’t, not with the grease and cardboard texture. Perhaps that is the barest form of love—survival calories. The only thing she knows how to give. And she did keep me alive enough, didn’t she? Well enough to seek out real love elsewhere, out there. Well enough to see Erika Kirk offer grace and unsettle something in me, performance or not. Maybe it doesn’t matter; maybe love is a performance until it isn’t, just one long slow burn until you don’t remember a time without warmth. Time to have a little more faith. I fish the rice out of the trash. Keep it stored in a cupboard, hopeful that an old friend who loves me will savor it.\n\nAnd strangely, I can see Charlie Kirk, standing by a dog. It’s not a dog that he’d pick out of the pound, this mangy mutt. It’s a crass thing that pisses itself when you try to take it out for some fun at the park. But I think Charlie Kirk would have pet that dog, fed it treats, called it a good dog when it brings him a ball, a bag of rice. Never kick it, no matter how annoyingly loud it yowls. No, Charlie could never cut me down to size the way my family has. Not Charlie, a man who’d delivered medical supplies to a friend’s husband when he was dying of cancer. So as crazy as it sounds…if he were alive, and I met him and befriended him, I know Charlie Kirk would love me more than my mom ever could. \n\nLove isn’t some intellectual game. Forgiveness isn’t some mental exercise. It can’t be coerced. You have to feel it. And this feels true, written again: Charlie Kirk would love me more than my mom ever could. With a start, I realize the reverse feels true, too. I could love Charlie Kirk more than I love my own mom. It’s excruciating, trying to love my mom, forgive her specific crimes. I lost so many years for her. Maybe it’s just impossible to mourn a living wound. It feels so much easier to try and love Charlie, forgive the fantasy of a dead man for his abstract harms against me. \n\nAnd maybe all love is agony, because I’m wrong to separate Charlie Kirk the man from Charlie Kirk the propagandist; they’re one and the same. Loving him means loving the man and the propagandist and the machine that uses him. So how do I feel this? I’m just a drooling dog at the edge of the stage, wagging its tail, waiting for a hand to come down and stroke its head. But I search for something. There was a phrase that Candace said Charlie liked, a twist on an old adage. The rest isn’t history, no. The rest is future. I have the rest of my life to make my future. And when I do, maybe I can forgive my mom. \n\nAnd so I end with a twist on an old prayer: Charlie Kirk, rest in future.\n***"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "A hedge fund trader taught me how to love. I had no idea what a wretched thing I was, until I met him. We met anonymously on Twitter in early-2022, love at first write. Real love, no min-maxing, no tweaking and twisting bits and pieces of your face and your body and your personality to fit some standard shell. Real love, not market logic. You'd think he'd be some Wall Street wanker, the meanest market machine of all. Always hedging, always derisking. He was __ ruthless at work, no doubt. His mind was a perfect terror, a Turing machine that drew derivatives from mere memory. Only I saw his tenderness, his soul that he poured into me through so many pieces of art and letters. Abstract portraits of me, lyrical little stories, handwritten Valentine's Day cards with poetic flourish. (It's so unfair that one person can hoard all these talents). During our breakup, I started thinking about what I must have cost him. Time he could've spent researching stocks that he spent on me instead. $100,000? $500,000? No, millions upon millions. He would never think this, much less say it. But I must've kept costing him and costing him until I couldn't anymore, until we dissolved."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This year, I searched for art to manage the breakup, at first favoring _Portrait of a Lady on Fire_ where two women who cannot be together remake Orpheus and Eurydice in their image. In the Greek myth, Orpheus descends into the Underworld to retrieve his beloved Eurydice on one condition: he must not look back at her. Just before he breaches the surface, he turns around. A mistake? Maybe. Or maybe Orpheus wanted to look. He wanted the memory over the living reality, and made the poet’s choice, not the lover’s. All good breakups are some flavor of the poet’s choice. We clawed our way through a long, slow, mutual ending, calling it “living in copeland,” the delusional liminal space where we pretended that he hadn’t changed his mind about having children. I think I took it especially hard because, between the two of us, he was always the one so certain about our future, while I was less sure. From the very start, he said we’d always be together. When I had doubts and whispered “Turn around and look at me,” he refused. But I should’ve known better. After all, a trader’s mind cannot see absolutes, only probabilities. He was 99% sure we’d get married, 1% sure he didn’t want children. The percentages flipped slowly, then all at once. One day, he honored my voice. He turned around to look at me one last time. And that was that. Love was behind us. Gone. Orpheus with his lyre in the land of the living, Eurydice lost to the hollow Underworld.\n\nI searched for more means to cope and seized upon a different piece of Greek mythos, love interpreted in _Eros the Bittersweet_ by Anne Carson. As Sappho says, Eros is _glukupikron_ : bittersweet, better translated as sweetbitter. It lives in paradox, in the shape of a triangle between the lover, beloved, and the distance between them. Love is a contradictory desire, like hunger. Once you eat the food, you cease to be hungry. Once the person you love becomes one with you, then they cease to exist as a desired other. “Whoever desires what is not gone? No one.” There’s science behind this ancient instinct; desire needs distance to stay alive. Collapse distance into familiarity, and love dies a thermal death: no risk, no novelty, no imagination. Collapse the triangle, and Eros suffocates in safety. Only in the absent-present can Eros breathe. This interpretation comforted me, knowing that I keep him by not having him, that I can make both the lover’s choice and the poet’s choice at the same time.\n\nI started seeing this impossible triangle everywhere. Physics is built on one, too: quantum mechanics explains the microscopic, Newtonian manages the macroscopic, and relativity rules the cosmic. Each reflects reality, but there is no theory of everything. Our cosmos lives in a tension no one can fully resolve. Love, like our universe, is held together not by union, but by the distance that keeps everything from collapsing into nothing. Recall a classic physics puzzle: when three celestial bodies interact, their gravitational forces create chaotic orbits so complex they cannot settle into a stable pattern. In Liu Cixin’s _The Three-Body Problem,_ three suns keep destroying all life on a planet they orbit. We had discussed the series at length, but we never realized that we lived on that planet, that our love was also a three-body problem. Our histories, our creations, and our distance. Lover, beloved, and the distance between us.\n\n# The First Sun is History\n\n _“Your story begins the moment Eros enters you.”_\n\n _Socrates, as quoted by Anne Carson in Eros the Bittersweet_\n\nThe past is Newtonian. Deterministic, linear, bound by rules—like memory’s fixation, like old love that keeps repeating in your mind. So I go back to the beginning, tracing my memory of his gap-toothed grin, his face winking in the twilight rain.\n\nI knew he truly loved me only a few weeks into our relationship. One night, he suggested a magic ritual. In his hedge fund days, he was assigned all sorts of esoteric, occult books to read. A small red volume from the 1800s about energy transference sunk its claws into him. He’d used its teachings for a sick family member, and was determined to save me too. By then, I’d struggled with suicidal depression for nearly twenty years, so why not try something a little crazy? So I followed him; laid down, placed my hands right, synced my breathing with his, closed my eyes until I sunk into hypnagogia, blurring dreams with reality between his droning intonations. The next morning, he asked what color I felt. “Red,” I replied without hesitation. “A dark one.” He consulted the book again to confirm the strange oppressive hue. At the time, the only effect I felt was my love for horror dissipating; I couldn’t stomach all the glorious gore as much anymore. As for him, he was shivery by the end, and slept far longer than his normal 4-5 hours a night. Looking back, it was this ritual that kickstarted a whole slew of new behavioral changes—trying ketamine infusions, changing careers, starting therapy again—that finally killed the passive voice in my head telling me to kill myself. Looking back, he really did sacrifice his own precious life force to save me. He loved me before I could love myself. _Love yourself first_ , says the culture. _Work on yourself until you deserve love._ Now I know what terrible propaganda that was. Only after being loved can you see technicolor. Only after being loved can the world crack open.\n\nI tried my best to love him back. He too, could be difficult to love. Self-made men wear scars. Though healed, the old wounds pull and wince. Even now I feel protective of him and his past. The best way to shield him and still be truthful is to say that his brilliant mind was haunted by statistics, and that I had no magic spells to banish any of his ghosts. I couldn’t salt his earth like he did for me. Looking back, our pasts alone were set on a collision course. Yet we saw no sudden end in fire, but rather a long slow freeze. We held onto each other like ice, hoping against all hope that it would keep its perfect shape. “Ice-crystal in the hands is at first a pleasure quite novel,” Carson writes, “But there comes a point—you can’t put the melting mass down, you can’t keep holding it.” You can try to suspend time, holding both presence and absence at once. You can try to violate Heisenberg’s principle, finding a particle’s position and momentum at once. You can try to keep ice intact in a warm palm, even with the certainty of melting. That is the lover’s mistake: to think you can hold on without destroying what you love.\n\n# The Second Sun is Creation\n\n _Love dares the self to leave itself behind, to enter into poverty._\n\n _Anne Carson in Decreation_\n\nThe future is quantum. Probability, uncertainty, entanglement—the unknowable state until observed, your life branching out like Sylvia Plath’s fig tree, until you choose the path. I imagine our co-created future, the one where the market demands everything of him, the one where our children demand everything of me.\n\nIn our almost-future, he would eat the same breakfast and follow the same routine to limit distractions from the physical world. Avocado, eggs, and pomegranate seeds. A long walk. Then he would lock himself in a soft squishy box of a room and sit in perfect stillness all day, only pushing buttons to execute trades. Time collapses. He goes into his trances again, merging with the machine—a vast web of nodes, vibrating with collective energy. If he feels the right signs and feeds the right energy back, he’s rewarded. He is beyond thought, beyond reason. He is pure intuition, some preternatural feminine mystique. Nothing short of catching on fire could sever him from his cold god. To me, the market is a Lovecraftian horror, a soulless, cosmic force that punishes and rewards with unfeeling caprice. I’m just a fly caught in its web. But daily he walks willingly into its maw. Sometimes I would bring him coffee. A supplication. My offering at the altar. The coffee would run cold most days. Only at nightfall would he return to me and say what he often says: “I love the market, but the market doesn’t love me.” _I love you, and you will always love the market more than me,_ I think, but don’t say. Perhaps I would’ve resented him for it eventually, though I don’t resent him now. How could I, staring into the face of something so resplendent? His true calling, his creation myth? I sit with this triangle: me, him, and the market. Lover, beloved, and the distance between us.\n\nI imagine myself, too, as my opposite—a homemaking tradwife. All the sweet, warm rituals that others desire, like marriage and kids, have always felt suspicious to me. But I could change. I could convert to his religion. I could abandon the hustle and bustle of a city for rural peace and quiet. I could decorate a mansion with flourish and aplomb. I could become soft and round and pregnant. I could feed our small litter of genius children with the finest fish from Japan. I could live the fantasy life of a fantasy woman, some Substack version of Ballerina Farm. I could be his perfect muse. In this almost-future, I find my own creation myth too—my children, born from my flesh and blood. My little horrors would consume me whole, and I would welcome them with open arms. Just like that, another triangle emerges: me, him, and our children. Lover, beloved, and the distance between us.\n\nI reached out to him once in the early summer days of 2025, asking whether we could make it work. I’d convinced myself that I saw his signs everywhere, wanting my return: his favorite number on the side of a boat in China, his math equations decorating my hotel shower walls. I’d convinced myself that I could give up everything—my city, my freedom, even my writing—for him. But he could never accept someone who extinguished her sun to spin around him. It took a gentle reminder about our diverging futures to shatter my delusion completely. He did leave me one final gift: the name of that esoteric magic ritual book. He hadn’t touched that book in over two years, but the same week he reread it, I had reached out to him again. Serendipity. Synchronicity. _Quantum entanglement._ “No question there’s energy beyond the scientifically explainable. Use it for good,” he wrote with a heart emoji. I wrote back, “I’ll always love you. That energy will always be there.”\n\n# The Third Sun is Distance\n\n _No one in love really believes that love will end._\n\n _Anne Carson in Eros the Bittersweet_\n\nThe present is relativity. Time dilates, mass shifts, meaning warps—relativity introduces perspective, a frame of reference. Everything you see through relativity depends on who you are, when you are, where you are. I felt the geographic distance then, with him often thousands of miles away. I feel the real distance now. And with it, I’ve gained perspective. Having children was only the first fissure. From the cracks, the sweetbitter truth surfaces.\n\nHe never loved a fantasy woman, some perfect muse. He loved a hard girl from a hard house. He loved a melancholic catnapper who slowed down his heart rate and put him to rest. When he was around me, he slept more and dreamed less. He chatted with me for hours everyday, trading away his trading for the mundane—getaway vacations and warm tea on balconies. I’m his favorite drug, he always told me. A cliché. But I never got him high; I was a better downer than the best barbiturate, smoothing away his ambition like waves lapping at stone. Maybe if I could raise his pulse, stir his drive, ignite his chase towards the outer edge of his brilliance instead of being a relaxing comfort…maybe we could’ve been something. But he needs a wife, not a sedative. And I need to be more than a drug, more than a resting place, more than a muse.\n\nFor three years, he reminded me that I was special, though I never believed him. I always thought him so remarkable, while I was average at best. Worse, I casted myself as a malefic force, a black hole that somehow seized a star. He’s destined to challenge the greatest traders of all time, Soros and Simons and every titan in history. But I didn’t think he could become peerless with me by his side; he would only circle the drain. From afar, I imagined people seeing his light spin around my darkness, spiraling and spiraling, never becoming a great blazing sun. And so I flung him back out into the stars, into the dark forest. Watched him touch escape velocity, where I cannot reach him.\n\nThat was the story I believed when I saw no light of my own. But now I know that I was never some cold gravity well. I didn’t pull him down; I held him steady. I was the one place where his mind could sleep. He was extraordinary—but I could become extraordinary, too. I only started writing because of our breakup. Only now am I beginning to burn. I too, am a living star, not some dark eternal.\n\nSo we had to part. In all universes we would’ve parted in some way. Whether divorce or sickness or death, I tell myself that I saved the agony for earlier rather than later; I tell myself that reality would have ground us to dust, made us into something sullied and sordid. He called me coral cat, an affectionate term for how often I sleep, but my sleepiness he found so charming could turn into laziness he despises. I called him whiplash, an affectionate term for how often he changes his mind, but his openness I found so charming could turn into flightiness I despise. We could have ruined each other. Instead, we loved each other enough to spare us the slow, unremarkable death of being forced into impossible shapes.\n\n _From within letters, Eros acts / Eros…can teach you the real nature of what is inside you._\n\n _Anne Carson in Eros the Bittersweet_\n\nMy life can be split into two parts: before him and after him. \n\nBefore him, I knew little of love. I’d collected other people’s definitions of it over the years: memes and pop songs, bell hooks’ idea that love is action and not a feeling, Zizek’s claim that if you have reasons to love someone then you don’t really love them. He showed me an unreasoned, nearly unconditional love. Love as magic rituals and writing—though I repeat myself. Writing is ritual, after all. In copeland, he hand-wrote me a breakup note, read aloud one last short story inspired by us, and begged me to share my writing with him too. I refused. I didn’t want to tether him to me through my new medium, my new lifeline. If only he knew how many private letters I wrote to him, how many public pieces I wrote about him, how I named my publication after a term he taught me. If only he knew how his absence threads through me, that everything I do is still stitched with his color.\n\nAfter him, I know that writing is the truest form of love, an “alphabetic relic” that keeps distance intact so that I can hold without having. As Carson writes, “the written word fixes living things in time and space, giving them the appearance of animation although they are abstracted from life and incapable of change.” Writing is a technology for sustaining the paradox, for keeping the in-between alive between lover and beloved. Writing is the lover’s choice and the poet’s choice at once. Writing is the ice in my hand that never melts. Writing is the triangle that always resolves. In the third and last book of the _Three-Body Problem_ series _,_ the unsung protagonist writes his love into three fairytales and flings them across light-years, knowing he will never stand beside his beloved. His unreturned love becomes the key to cosmic salvation. I understand this hero perfectly now. Writing is my transmission across the distance, my fairytale where impossible geometry is possible. Writing this, it’s almost like we’re still together, saving the universe.\n\nI accept that I can only let him go by never letting go. Love has always left its unique footprint on me; I have never stopped loving any of my former loves. And this was my greatest love by far, with its tensile beauty of a spider’s web, intact only when untouched. His love, the tender, sweetbitter revelation that I was not meant to live without love, doesn’t vanish just because our future did. I am taking his love and feeding it back to myself. I am becoming the person who can stand in presence, not just in the absent-present. And one day, I’ll offer an unreasoned, nearly unconditional love to someone who wants my strange, daily weather. Through all of it, the writing must go on. It is the only place where holding on and letting go weave the same thread, the one planet whose three suns spin in a stable orbit, the closest thing I have to a theory of everything.\n***"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "\"Nuclear war is good because it ends life, which is suffering\" punched me in the throat. The first time I heard it, my words tangled in my mouth, caught behind my teeth. I had no response.\n\nOver time, I learned to roll with the hits. It sounds like it crawled out from deep inside an irony poisoned 4chan thread, but it is actually a serious argument for serious people.\n\nWelcome to anti-natalism, where life is so awful that it is better never to be born. A theory used to defend nuclear war. A fringe idea for fringe nerds, like me—a former policy debater. To my suicidal teenage self, the idea that it was cruel to bring life into the world felt oddly comforting. It affirmed the death I felt inside.\n\nToday, it is a cold comfort at best. For the first time in 31 years, I am entertaining switching sides, just like I did in debate.\n\nI am considering becoming someone's mother. How terrifying."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My early twenties were terrible, especially in romance. Partly because I was a mess, partly because I was recovering from being an argumentative asshole, and partly because every relationship was a nonstarter after I dropped the childfree bomb. Even the women I dated wanted kids. Just my luck; all the queers are heteronormative. Where are the 44% of people who don’t want children? I was ready to give up and take it a step further as a single, childless AND cat-free lady. \n\nThen in my late twenties, I randomly, _finally_ met a man who didn’t want kids. But between the two of us, I was the one truly childfree. My shitty, stressful childhood gifted me with an autoimmune disease, making pregnancies higher risk. And the silence of my biological clock lingers—an absence I can’t escape. \n\nMy now ex was reluctantly childfree. For reasons I won’t get into publicly, he recently changed his mind. Now he wants a gaggle of sweet kids running about a midcentury house. I should have seen it coming. After all, I chose the human version of switch-side debate. “Whiplash” is his name on my phone. My whip smart sweetheart gave me whiplash once again. \n\nBut maybe, just maybe, I’m the one who will whip around this time. Love could be the activation energy that moves my mind. \n\nI poured that new vigor into a strange new world. Despite being childfree, I had not actively engaged with childfree content before. So I dove deep into online childfree communities, listened to podcasts like _DINKY_ , and read _Regretting Motherhood_ by Orna Donath.\n\nOn the flip side, I asked friends for their parenting stories, learned how children learn, attended my first baby shower, and made crafts with millennial mothers. \n\nBaby shower block painting party! I made (K)isses and (L)ove for little James, due late November\n\nIn short, I did what I do best: ignored my emotions, disappeared into my head, and gathered evidence for the greatest debate round of my life. _Resolved: I should have children because I will enjoy motherhood_. Easy enough. I negate the resolution: stay childfree because I will regret motherhood but won’t regret non-motherhood.\n\nBut the evidence was sparse. I could easily find regretful parenting stories, no problem. But do people who choose NOT to have kids regret it? As taboo as it is to regret parenthood, it seems even more taboo to say you chose to be childfree and then regretted it decades later. My generation is also likely the first where foregoing children became a widespread, real choice — the data simply isn’t there yet. \n\nWithout good data and studies, I tried another strategy. I negate the resolution: having children is selfish, horrible for the environment, and destructive in a hundred ways.\n\n _A sure win_ , I thought. All the evidence is in childfree communities. My people.\n\nBut I found myself grimacing. Turns out that David Benatar, father of anti-natalism, is practically a household name with 225,000 devotees. Not such a fringe idea after all. And with 1.5 million subscribers, the main childfree forum fared no better. I like children, so the nasty language used to describe them stunned me: _crotch goblins_ and _parasites_ and _spawn_. \n\nAt baseline, it made more sense to view having children as a neutral stance. People must reproduce to continue existing. It is neither good nor bad. It just is. \n\nAs I slowly recover from “objecting to having been born,” I have grown sentimental towards sentient life, this strange fickle thing perhaps only we have in the universe. I’m more persuaded that we should continue our species rather than end it. Expecting the next generation to solve bigger and tougher problems, including ones we likely caused ourselves (like climate change), might be unfair. But that’s evolution, baby. \n\nI couldn’t convince myself of the usual childfree critiques. Back to the drawing board then. I negate the resolution: stay childfree and enjoy my life.\n\nWhat better model than the lives of famous and wealthy childfree women? I made a small list: Anna Kendrick, Katharine Hepburn, Helen Mirren, Winona Ryder, Oprah Winfrey, Stevie Nicks, Dolly Parton, Chelsea Handler, Sarah Paulson, Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nLike me, Stevie Nicks hails from Phoenix, Arizona. According to her, if she’d had children, Fleetwood Mac never would have happened. Motherhood was not her destiny.\n\n“Maybe my particular mission was to write songs to make moms and wives feel better.” \n\nStevie Nicks \n\nWell, I’m not goddamn Stevie Nicks. I don’t have a talent meant for billions to enjoy. I’m not even a girl boss who would resent giving up traveling. My best accomplishment so far is not killing myself. I never thought I’d make it past 30, yet I emerged from the black pit, victorious. But I’m entirely empty of dreams. So what _exactly_ am I giving up if I had children? \n\nContent like Chelsea Handler’s gave me no comfort either. I wondered if women like her were truly happy, because happy people don’t feel the need to rub their happiness in everyone’s faces. I concluded that I just can’t relate to most childfree women. \n\nA small suspicion sprang to mind, this time directed at the childfree stance: \n\n**Why identify so strongly with the lack of something?**\n\nOne interpretation: parenthood is a community that people opt into, while non-parents are left out for the crime of staying the same. So maybe this godless religion is a way to feel less alone.\n\nI asked myself why I didn’t feel alone, having never felt the need to participate in these communities. \n\nAnd there it was. The key, waiting. I’d been searching for answers outside myself, dissecting the logic, avoiding what lies within. But now, I’ve finally reached the door to my emotions. I had been too intellectual about this, debating myself in circles. \n\nSo I forfeit the debate. Leave my head, follow my heart. \n\nI need to feel this. \n\nI turn the key and step inside. \n\nI know why I don’t identify with the lack of something. \n\nI know why I can’t proselytize like others do. \n\nI’ve never been scared of being alone. I’ve always felt like there was an invisible wall separating me from others. I can press my fingers against the glass, and the few who reach back meet my fingers with their own. But I can’t feel the warmth of that phantom touch. \n\nIt’s okay for me. I’m used to it, feeling not-quite-human. \n\nBut there’s no way I want that feeling for my children. I want them to be happy, secure, playful. \n\nI’m scared that I can’t give that to them, when I can’t even give that to myself. \n\nI close my eyes, and I remember Sophia.\n\nSophia, Sophia. My broken mirror, Sophia. \n\nOf all the stories I’ve come across, hers is the one that truly haunts me. She shares a background marked by violence, much like mine. \n\nBut she always dreamed of having children. She believed that giving her kids everything she didn’t have, granting them the childhood she’d always longed for, would be her path to healing. She thought nothing could be more meaningful. \n\nAfter having two children, she realizes that her belief is “total bullshit.” \n\n_Why is it bullshit_? I want to scream. _TELL ME, SOPHIA!_ I comb through her story desperately, searching for her reasoning. \n\nBut Sophia is silent. She never explains why. \n\nI plunge into cold despair. \n\nThe nightmare is so clear. Flickering scenes flash between past and present, present and future, beauty and agony. I can see my little darling, my life, my only. I lie on the bed most of the day, nearly comatose. Just like how I was in college. \n\n“Why is Mommy so sad all the time?” my child whispers to their father. I see him shake his head, now completely gray, each strand a testament to sorrow. Slowly, then all at once, my child inherits my darkness. Their eyes become open wounds, swallowing everything light and pure and good. \n\nI open my eyes to the sobering daylight. \n\nI would damn my children to a lifetime of being outsiders, like me. I would pollute them with my lack. I just know I would. I can scarcely bear the thought. \n\n_But what if I’m wrong_? A tiny voice stirs. I’m wrong all the time. Why wouldn’t I be wrong at the worst time, sinking a great love and an entire world of children and grandchildren and magnificent dreams to the bottom of the sea? \n\nI’m not one for regrets, I reassure myself. _But this is different_ , the voice insists. I could end up an old woman, staring out the window with only regrets instead of a view. \n\nThe voice rings with truth, but the regrets feel inseparably yoked. \n\n_Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—_\n\nI regret not having kids with someone I love, or I regret becoming a mother. \n\nWhich regret would I rather have? \n\nI wish I could say. I wish writing this helped.\n\nI’d been searching for these stories and statistics like they were scattered keys, hoping that the right one would unlock the right door. But I realize now that they will always slip through my fingers. There is no other door. There is only this one old door I already opened, and it leads me into the same empty room. \n\nI stand there in silence. It’s only me inside, waiting for my answer. \n\nThis decision is mine alone. \n\nAnd it has to come from my true self. \n\nI open my mouth to speak, but the words catch.\n\nI don’t know who I am. \n***"}]}
