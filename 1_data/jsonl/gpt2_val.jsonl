{"text": "Hero worship isn’t in my wiring. But reading and learning about the polymathic French philosopher, sociologist, Nazi Resistance fighter, and Christian anarchist Jacques Ellul comes pretty close. I finally understood the banality of evil upon hearing Ellul recall the Nuremberg trials. The head of camp Bergen-Belsen was asked if it was horrible, overseeing so many corpses. He had replied: _“What could I do? The capacity of the ovens was too small…I had no time to think about those people. I was too busy with that technical problem of my ovens._ ” Violence was a technical malfunction, atrocity a throughput issue. Ellul saw the hidden disease in that response: where efficiency lives, responsibility dies.\n\n---\n\nIn two of his most famous yet underrated works, The Technological Society (1954), which I’ve just started reading, and Propaganda: The Formation of Men’s Attitudes (1962), which I read two months ago, Ellul conducts a cold autopsy of modernity. With surgical precision, he clarified the confusions I've carried for years, from when I both spread and suffered from propaganda. Ellul gave me the words I lacked. His prescient insight: propaganda is a powerful form of technology, what he called _technique_ —the logic of efficiency. Propaganda is the technique of conformity: it integrates us into technological society at the low, low cost of our agency. If violence is a mere byproduct of a technical system we conform to, then no one is responsible, since no one makes choices. And if no one makes choices, then no one is free. Through efficiency and conformity, we’re made to feel free. But in reality, modernity has robbed us of freedom with no force at all.\n\n## Technique: The Infection called Efficiency\n\nA spectre haunts modernity. Many have spoken of it: Vervaeke’s meaning crisis, Foucault and Orwell’s biopolitical surveillance, Weber’s disenchanted world, Marx’s alienation by capitalism, Nietzsche’s mournful cry “God is dead.” But you don’t need to be a great thinker to feel sick. You might intuit that technology has something to do with the brainrot, the loneliness, the tribalism. Yet we’re still mired in a tired debate about technology: it is either good or bad or—if you fancy nuance—neutral (“it depends on who owns it”). Optimists see technology as the inevitable march towards progress, while doomers see it as a harbinger of dystopia. The nuanced could love autonomous driving but hate Elon Musk, so Waymo it is. And since Zuckerberg is an alien wearing a human suit, maybe we shouldn’t let him “move fast and break things.” In the end, we wring our hands and say, technology has granted us so much, but there’s some bad excess. It lurks in the allure of the algorithm, so let’s try to tame the beast. All we have to do is delete TikTok. All we have to do is write without AI. All we have to do is keep a watchful eye on the devil, and all will be cured.\n\nWhether technology is savior or villain or neither misses the scope of Ellul’s much larger, darker diagnosis: we have been infected with the machine logic of efficiency applied everywhere to everything. We suffer from Technology with a capital T, or the poorly translated concept of _technique_ , the broader driving force behind technology (etymologically, technology means “the study of technique”). Skeptics say, we have always used techniques to transform the world. Which is true. However, in pre-modern times, techniques served human ends, such as ritual and worship of God and nature. But modernity, which has profaned and desacralized the natural world and God, has elevated technique to the sacred instead. Deprived of our fundamental needs for connection with nature, one another, and the sacred, we turn to even more techniques as substitutes. Even if we set aside the gadgets and gears, less visible forms of technique thrive: doctors prescribe pills to return people to productivity, McKinsey consultants distill decisions to KPI dashboards, marketers create copy for clicks and conversions, educators teach to the test. Every field, institution, community, and relationship across the globe is invaded by technique, even our most intimate selves. How many of us dress up our dating profiles? Polish our LinkedIn pages? Leverage “life hacks” in our lives? Search, scour, scramble for the “one best way” to be?"}
{"text": "The author reviews Avatar: Fire and Ash. They consider the fire-worshipping Na'vi faction and its leader the strongest element but feel the clan is underused in the final act. They note a surprising suicide bomber scene and a culturally revealing comment from their Chinese mother. The final third is criticized for repeating battle sequences from the first two films. The author proposes alternative narrative choices involving Tulkun pacifism and argues the human-vs-Na'vi ethical dilemma is underexplored, since the Na'vi winning implies human extinction. They close by noting an effective Biblical allusion.\n\n---\n\nAvatar: Fire and Ash was better than part 2 for the first two-thirds, mostly because of Varang aka the Horny for Fire Hottie. Incredible choice to introduce a clan of Fire Paganists who've left God/Eywa and then have them do nothing in the last third.\n\nStill, blockbusters rarely surprise me, yet James Cameron managed to do it with the Fire suicide bomber. At that scene, my Chinese mom turned to me and whispered knowingly, \"Ah, they're Japanese!\" (The white liberal mind cannot comprehend the enmity between ethnic minorities.)\n\nMy main critique of the last third is that it was boring, since it repeated the fight climaxes from both part 1 and part 2. I would've preferred something daring. If Cameron was more of a risk-taking auteur, he should've forced us to watch whale genocide. Have the Tulkuns decide they'd rather keep their culture of nonviolence even in the face of annihilation. No self-defense. Not even when it's necessary. They'd become true Christ-like figures and open up immense dialogue.\n\nAlso, the ethical dilemma vis-a-vis humans vs Na'vi isn't fully explored, since humans are painted indisputably as The Bad Guys. In reality, Cameron is asking the audience to cheer for the self-genocide (anthropocide? omnicide?) of humanity. In this universe, people already killed their mother Earth and are searching for a new home as space-navigators, so the Na'vi winning likely means the total destruction of the human species. Maybe the next installment(s) will address this?\n\nFinally, I did appreciate an Old Testament scene in the last third. A twisted version of Isaac's sacrifice, but emotional and powerful nonetheless."}
