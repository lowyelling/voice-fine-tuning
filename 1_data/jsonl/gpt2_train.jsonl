{"text": "The author recounts being recruited to interview at Nvidia but not advancing. They describe sensing smugness during the process and reflect that not getting the job was a net positive — they didn't care about pricing strategy and would have tied their identity to an elite institution. They close by arguing that elite interviews are still valuable because defending your thinking under high standards sharpens you, even in rejection.\n\n---\n\nI interviewed at Nvidia last year. Didn't apply. They asked me to interview, which felt like a win.\n\nNvidia is one of the most valuable companies in the world; 70-80% of its employees are reportedly millionaires. Believe me, the air of superiority and smugness was palpable, even through a phone interview.\n\nThey didn't move me forward. I lacked some specific experience. Weirdly, I'm glad I didn't get the job. Would it be incredible to work at Nvidia? No doubt. The money and prestige alone are life-changing.\n\nBut I don't really care for pricing strategy. And I think my life would've become worse in strange, incalculable ways. I'd tie my identity to my job, for one. Always \"Nvidia\" in my bio, then forever \"ex-Nvidia.\" I'm better off slowly shedding the desire to be anointed by Elite Institutions.\n\n100% worth interviewing at Elite Institutions though. I got grilled on my math models, my impact; every detail flipped over and examined under a microscope.\n\nEvery person should experience sitting in a hot seat, defending their thinking. High standards sharpen, even in rejection."}
{"text": "The author, a UHC customer, shares rapid-fire reactions to the shooting of CEO Brian Thompson. They note relief that a powerful target was chosen over children, defend Second Amendment views, and express sympathy for the family. They discuss the killer's bullet-casing slogan, describe Thompson as embodying the banality of evil, and note his wife's unintentionally comic quote about \"a lack of coverage.\" They observe rare cross-partisan unity in public reaction, compare the event to Shinzo Abe's assassination as a shift toward targeted political violence, note corporate panic responses, and close by refusing to celebrate death while enjoying the memes.\n\n---\n\nI'm an American with United Healthcare insurance. UHC CEO Brian Thompson was recently shot and killed.\n\nSome straight shooter thoughts:\n\nFirst gut reaction: \"Finally, some crazy dude chose a powerful target instead of school children.\" Yeah, the bar is in hell.\n\nI'm still pro-2nd amendment, always have been—even when people were shooting up kids. Can't take the Arizona out of me. It wouldn't surprise me if we pass gun control legislation over a CEO and not dead kids though.\n\nI feel for Brian's family, especially his kids. They will be taunted by the video of his murder for the rest of their lives. I hope they get help.\n\nWhen the killer revealed skill and professionalism, I wondered if it was a hit job. The healthcare industry operates like a cartel so actual mafia techniques aren't too far fetched to me. Brian Thompson was being investigated over allegations of insider trading. A lot of people would kill for a lot less.\n\nThen reports emerged about the killer's slogan on bullet casings: Deny. Defend. Depose. Damn if that doesn't go hard. Undeniable bars. What a clever refutation of Delay, Defend, Deny.\n\nBy all accounts (*in mainstream media), Brian was a good person in his personal life. At the same time, he made millions off the suffering and death of countless Americans. He was both victim and killer, the face of the banality of evil.\n\nI try not to, but I do judge men by their girlfriends and wives. And Brian's wife dropped the best Onion headline ever with zero effort while grieving. She said that Brian was receiving threats over \"I don't know, a lack of coverage?\" +1 for peak comedy.\n\nBrian Thompson's unnamed murderer is likely a killer/victim too.\n\nHis killer should be brought to justice, no matter how noble his reasons. The courts will have a hard time finding an unbiased jury though, and jury nullification is always an option.\n\nThe reaction across the spectrum—left, right, Facebook normies, nurses and doctors, NYT and Zero Hedge and Ben Shapiro commenters—has been united in a way I haven't seen since 9/11. It's weirdly energizing, hopeful, yet extremely depressing at the same time. We're so ineffectual that violent Girardian scapegoating is all we have left.\n\nFlirting with a hot hostel chick revealed the killer's face. You can't make this shit up. Women do be the death of men.\n\nIn \"oh no he's hot\" news, women want to fuck the killer. I'm looking forward to all the hybristophilia fanfiction. The attention from women will absolutely influence future shooters, which would be a massive improvement to school shootings. Stop gunning down kids, fellas. RETVRN to impressing Jodie Foster.\n\nShinzo Abe's assassination probably started this vibe shift from mass killing kids to targeted, politically motivated shootings. There's 2 guns in all of Japan and they're both locked up in a cabinet, but Tetsuya Yamagami managed to make his own gun and kill Abe, avenging his family for falling prey to a cult with ties to powerful Japanese people like Abe. And Japan collectively went \"oh shit Yamagami had a point.\"\n\nHealthcare insurance companies have been removing executive photos and About Me pages, and Blue Cross Blue Shield reversed an anesthesia time limit policy yesterday. It would be very American to solve healthcare through gun violence. Likelier scenario though is they sneak that policy back on us in a few months. We're going to learn how to raw dog surgery when the news dies down.\n\nI'm personally not going to celebrate death, which applies across the board from American war criminals like Kissinger or for expected enemies like Osama bin Laden and Gaddafi. To me it feels spiritually decaying. But if you hit me with counterpoint: Hitler, I may have to concede.\n\nI am going to keep enjoying the memes though. Keep playing your tiny violins."}

I've had several autoimmune attacks over the years and in the throes of this latest one, I'm finally seeing the shape of my shadow. She likes me when I'm sick.

You cut me at the Achilles when I'm running too far, enjoying life too much, succeeding too fast. You don't think I can take care of myself when I'm evolving in my soft cocoon. You don't believe I can handle happiness. So you spin your phantom thread tighter and tighter until I'm immobile and wordless. You suffocate me so you can resuscitate me. You are the only one who can wean me back to life.\n\nAnd you know what? You're right. I can't take care of myself.\n\nIf I work, I stop exercising. If I go out with friends, I stop working. If I write, I stop cleaning. If I read, I stop sleeping. I'm all or nothing when delirious on life, a manic bird in flight longing for a glass window. I only slow down when I slam into the pane. So I'll admit it.\n\nI like being sick. I like being sick. I like being sick.\n\nIf I say it again and again, will you let me go? You must know that I understand you now. Thank you for taking care of me. Thank you for raising me.\n\nNow will you crawl outside the cave into the sun? Will you let me thank you in the light? My whole life I've waited to see your true face."}

{"text": "The author rejects the FIRE movement's premise that work is something to escape. They describe a past obsession with net worth tracking while working in Bay Area tech, followed by a shift in perspective after leaving the industry. They compare money to water that stagnates when hoarded. They describe their current corporate Strategy and Ops role as disconnected from meaningful work, a pattern of switching jobs every 1.5-2 years, and a current attempt to find purpose through small acts of service at work. Writing provides the primary sense of purpose. They predict future generations will condemn how society separated work from meaning.\n\n---\n\nI don't want to retire.\n\nLike so many other techies in the Bay Area, I used to be possessed by FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early). I believed that work is punishing by nature, that I must nobly suffer through it, endure just enough until I'm free to live my real, actual life.\n\nI cannot stress enough: this mindset is bullshit.\n\nA few years ago, I left the Bay and tech. I stopped tracking my net worth. Why was I, a naturally frugal person, obsessing over numbers on a screen? Crypto further helped numb me to wild double or triple digit swings; it really emphasized the fake nature of my obsession. Later, it dawned on me that my mental model of money was wrong, too. Money is a form of energy; it has to move, breathe, flow like water. Hoarding causes it to stagnate. Stagnant water sustains some life, but only a tepid one. A bare life.\n\nI don't want to retire from work. I want vital work. Living, spiritual, purposeful work. I crave energy, and I'm so far away from it. My day job is Strategy & Ops, which just means I pull data for dashboards and PowerPoint slides that keep execs happy. I feel divorced from the real value and lifeblood of the business, not that I particularly care for this industry either. In the past, the dissonance would catch up to me with a fury, and I would compulsively switch jobs every 1.5 or 2 years. Always running, always trying to escape.\n\nNow, as I approach 2 years in this role, I'm trying to flip the script. 95%+ of people would kill to have a glorified email job like mine, but bashing myself over the head with that fact never helps. I'm leaning into some strange form of cope-gratitude: caring for coworkers as a form of value creation, making pretty slide decks as an act of service. It still feels like pulling teeth most days, to be honest. Worse comes to worse, I tell myself that this job grants me the bandwidth to write. Until I find the work I was made for, this is how I can step into the stream. This is how I can tap into that moving energy.\n\nIn a few hundred years, people will look back at our society and condemn it as barbaric, the way we severed work from purpose. They'll wonder how we ever lived this way."}
{"text": "The author argues that AI has shifted software engineering from writing code to coordinating autonomous AI agents. They reference Steve Yegge's Kubernetes-like orchestration system, explaining how commoditization pushes value to the coordination layer. They introduce a barbell framework: value concentrates at the top (vision, taste, directing agents) and the bottom (physics, hardware, manufacturing) while standard apps in the middle are being eliminated. They suggest the pattern extends to most corporate work. The author writes from a self-described techno-ambivalent perspective, observing these changes at an AI bootcamp.\n\n---\n\nThe software engineer is their own bottleneck now.\n\nAI is a coordination problem; code (work) is just a byproduct.\n\nPeople really have no idea what's going on. The distance between what the public thinks AI can do and what people are actually doing with it right now is the widest it has ever been.\n\nThe average person probably still conceives of AI as a smart and fun chatbot or image generator. The curious person understands that AI can generate code in a fancy autocomplete sort of way. An engaged person might be following Andrej Karpathy tweets, but even top-level minds aren't properly explaining the frontier because the frontier is being built every second, so we end up with (probably true) memes like \"Billion-dollar unicorn startups by a single person are now possible.\" The real root is that most software engineering work—and probably most/all other corporate work—is no longer about the work itself. The real work is about solving the coordination of autonomous workers who don't eat, sleep, rest.\n\nI'm neither a techno-optimist nor dystopian, really more techno-ambivalent (Jacques Ellul) or techno-probabilistic (Josh Davila). Despite being more tech-critical, I'm into my third week at Fractal Tech AI software engineering bootcamp to peer into the frontier. Consider this the tech bro day 14 post that I skipped yesterday, since I really had to mull this one over. Because even though 50% of Fractal's program has to be rewritten every 3-4 months to keep up with the pace of AI, we're still not really keeping pace.\n\nEach week, I'm seeing some NYC engineers that are blowing my mind.\n\nPeople are token-maxxing and optimizing for price/token, commanding 10+ AI coding agents at once. A full workforce, a hivemind. Each AI agent is a worker bee with a separate role (writing code, reviewing it, handling merges, monitoring other worker bees etc). The queen bee engineer sits at the top and just describes what they want to build. How they do this can be wildly different—some engineers spend all day speaking English to their AI, and have their full-time Quality Assurance test engineer from the other side of the world review the ~20% edge cases while they sleep. Others draw intricate system diagrams with Mermaid and feed those plans to AI.\n\nVeteran engineer Steve Yegge built a whole orchestration system for this subagent workflow, likening it to Kubernetes.\n\nI didn't know what Kubernetes was, so I had Claude explain it to me. Kubernetes is the system that Google invented to manage thousands of servers. You don't need to say \"run this app on server #42\"—you just say \"I want 3 copies of this app running at all times\" and Kubernetes figures out the details. Now I see the pattern. As products are commoditized (become standardized), the value moves up to the coordination layer above.\n\nBarbell Economics - the middle is dying\n\nBefore I entered this program, I had a thesis: if AI solves software, it pushes the best engineers down the stack. Software is abstraction layered on abstraction, declarative layers on top of imperative cores, all the way down to physics. If AI handles the upper layers, then expertise migrates to the lower ones—hardware, materials science, manufacturing. Back to the real world where you fight with atoms, since not even AI agents can bend the speed of light. I had hoped this would trigger a manufacturing renaissance in the U.S.\n\nBut what I saw last week weren't the best minds going down toward physics. They were going up, actually—becoming pure coordination layers. So what's actually forming is a barbell where value concentrates at two extremes:\n\nAt the top: vision, taste, knowing what to build, directing the hive. The bottleneck here is imagination, agency, and our need to sleep.\n\nAt the bottom: atoms. Physics. Reality has the final say with semiconductor fabs, battery chemistry, rockets to Mars."}
{"text": "_Hey David Foster Wallace, I know why you killed yourself. Roped yourself, as the kids say. Me too bro._\n\nThat was my message ten years ago in a proposed speech as an OGS: Outstanding Graduating Senior. I thought I could address DFW, mirroring his famous 2005 _This is Water_ commencement speech at Kenyon. But back then, I was a different kind of OGS: Obviously Gonna Suicide. I was unprocessed, seeking an audience—a raw slab of meat bleeding out in public. It was unbecoming. Somewhat undignified. But worst of all, _too serious_.\n\nGuess who didn't get to speak at commencement.\n\nWhile I'm free of suicidal ideation now, I'm still not free from writing about suicide, sorry :) I used many normal and many weird methods to climb to a decent place, but coping with the absolute nadir was its own beast.\n\nFor me, this many-headed monster met its match with dark humor.\n\n---\n\n# A Scream\n\nWhy did I want to kill myself? I was in good company; 1 person dies by suicide every 40 seconds. Sure, the world sucks and life is absurd and meaningless. But plenty of people keep rolling that boulder back up. There is no singular reason for suicide. \n\nBut what we do know is that suicide is a scream for help. A meaner or ignorant person might say it is a cry for attention, which…well, no shit. Someone who attempts suicide needed attention at some point—or many points—in their lives. They were cast aside or received the wrong kind of attention. As DFW wrote in _This is Water_ , “Most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.” \n\nSo why are people dead inside already? Also a complex question. \n\nMy culprit was trauma. All kinds of it, since I was a kid. Physical abuse, medical neglect, sexual violence, emotional damage. My body was smart and shielded me in every way it could. I know its survival methods worked because I live. But sometimes they worked too well. Long after the shocks, my body stayed tethered to the past, believing itself a watchful sentinel who guarded me from harm. But it became my warden instead, holding me hostage in that pitch-black pit. Trauma reverberated through time, severing me from others—and from myself. \n\nWhile severed, I lost the ability to trust myself. \n\nWhile severed, I confused violence for love and safety for horror. \n\nWhile severed, I thought suicide was the natural end and my final destiny. \n\nThe beast in the pit tore me apart. But dark humor came with thread and needle, weaving fibers between the severed pieces. I felt the stitches forming, a small rebellion. Laughing until I was in stitches, laughter stitching me back together, over and over again. \n\n# A Meme\n\nThat essay I wrote for the commencement speech? Thank God it wasn’t chosen, not only because of the cringe. Thank God it wasn’t chosen because I could have inspired a slew of suicides around me. Suicide has a funny tendency to spread, as if it were socially contagious. This copycat effect gives suicide a uniquely viral, meme-like quality. That’s why media must responsibly report on suicide, else we end up with a situation like Anthony Bourdain, who killed himself in a similar fashion to Kate Spade two days after her death.\n\nNow hold on. Isn’t joking about suicide pretty irresponsible? Wouldn’t suicide memes increase suicide contagion? It’s a great question, and the public health community debates the question with compelling evidence for either side. \n\nFor me, dark jokes about suicide worked. Laughter needs no overwrought explanation; it lives in my gut. Give me all the suicide memes—they cut through the static in my brain, interrupt all my thoughts. That many-headed beast? It was my own mind, my own thoughts replicating _kill yourself kill yourself kill yourself_. \n\nThe great hydra is a mind virus and suicide is one strange, strange meme. But humor is a meme too; it spreads just as fast, if not faster. There’s no better way to counter a dark meme than with an even blacker one. \n\nIn meme-on-meme warfare, may the best meme win. \n\n# A Killer Joke"}
{"text": "# Book One: Genesis\n\n>  _ **\"** In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\" Genesis 1:1_\n\n#####  **Age: 7 - Community**\n\nI met God on Sundays in Fremont, California.\n\nWith other Chinese immigrants who fled the CCP for faith and a better life, my family congregated at a Bay Area Protestant church. We crammed into a dingy, narrow building with flickering lights and frayed carpeting, sidestepping cracks all over the sidewalk. Once, my baby brother tripped on a big one and cut his knee clean open. The church ladies cooed over him with bandages and antiseptic. We found care, and care was God.\n\n---\n\nTo a kid, God wasn’t the boring adult sermons read aloud from a chunky black-bound Chinese translation. He wasn’t the kiddie versions of Bible stories, fun as they were. He wasn’t the verses I memorized to win cute stickers for my binders of printed hymns. No, God was a glass noodle dish brimming with wood ear mushrooms, carrots, and cabbage. He lived in the potluck line, in every steaming bowl families brought as a show of care. Those communal lunches were my Eden. Better than stickers.\n\nA few years later my life began to echo _Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret_. Like Judy Blume’s heroine, I swapped a city apartment for a suburban house, and soon I was church-hopping across Phoenix with my family, testing altars and aisles the way Margaret sampled synagogues and steeples. We joined one congregation twice a week—Thursday nights as well as Sundays. It was everything our dingy Fremont church wasn’t: a sprawling campus of new buildings wrapped around a pristine playground. I didn’t realize it then, but we already had one foot out of Eden and the other edging into Bosch’s _Garden of Earthly Delights_. In retrospect, twice-weekly services at a gleaming chapel were less about devotion and more about overcompensation.\n\nWe soon traded the megachurch for a modest Latin-American Catholic parish, where we were the lone Asian family and more crucially, the only ones who couldn’t speak Spanish. I just shrugged and raced with the other kids; God had no language barrier. But my parents saw only the Tower of Babel and balked. The language gap soon grew into an excuse to slip out of church life altogether.\n\n# Book Two: Job\n\n>  _“I cry to you for help and you do not answer me; I stand, and you only look at me.” Job 30:20_\n\n#####  **Age: 10 - Prayers**\n\nA dinner plate smashed against the tile, rice splayed across the floor. My parents were fighting again. According to the Bible, I just needed to pray every night for help, and help will come. So I kneeled by my bed, hands tight in prayer. _Are you there God? It’s me, Lily._ Margaret had asked, and her parents stopped shouting.\n\nBut my parents never stopped. And my father kept breaking every object in sight—mom’s cooking, the air conditioner, a clothes hanging dryer. On my birthday, he destroyed my brand-new bicycle that I’d excitedly picked out the day before. When objects ran out, the beatings began.\n\nI prayed harder, but nothing came back. I was no Margaret. And I was no Job, rewarded two-fold for unwavering faith. I realized that if I’d been cast into Hell, then I must be wicked. I didn’t beg to uneat the fruit of knowledge. Instead, I concluded that for evil children like me, birthdays weren’t real and God wasn’t real. In God’s absence came a voice telling me to kill myself. That voice stayed with me for over twenty years. And to this day, I can’t stand my birthday.\n\n#####  **Age: 14 - Debate**\n\nIn the early 2000s, Christian Conservatives wielded ironclad power. A Constitutional ban on gay marriage was in the cards, and members of the Bush administration branded _Harry Potter_ as witchcraft. But in a parallel universe called the Internet, New Atheism was a swelling spring tide, a backlash that echoed like my own hollowed out faith. I didn’t own a computer yet, but I could feel the undertow of that other world, churning with heretics and arguments I had yet to understand. The day I got my own laptop for debate, the current claimed me. I slipped into the stream and atheism swept me away."}
{"text": "I've been daydreaming about chasing a girl in Chengdu, Sichuan. When I flew to my hometown in April, I had just two expectations: see my sick 90-year-old grandpa and treat my pre-cervical cancer. And honestly, I prioritized the novel treatment over tepid bonds with my relatives. For me, family is a river reflecting shame. The shame ran so deep that I almost canceled the trip—cancer care be damned. But fear of death made me channel _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_ , so __ I bought the ticket and took the ride. In contrast to Thompson's drug-addled escape from a dying American dream, I meant for my ride to be repressed and resigned. I was a body on autopilot, searching for a cure that would, in the most literal sense, save my life. Instead, I found feeling, a soul stirring. A pulse thawed from permafrost. Real, life-saving, erotic energy.\n\n---\n\n### Shame as a cold river\n\nI last stood in Sichuan nine years ago, staring at the ancient Dujiangyan irrigation system, meditating on shame. Over two thousand years ago, engineers forked the wild Min river with a levee instead of a dam. One branch swallows the floods, the other feeds over 2,000 square miles of fertile fields to this day. Water is to life as _saving face_ is to Chinese culture. An alien concept to Westerners, _face_ refers to social status cultivated through virtue and achievement, not just for yourself, but for your family and friends. Face is a collective reservoir, easily drained. A child’s good job refills the cistern; a moral lapse cracks the embankment for everyone. When the reservoir bursts, its runoff surges into my river. Lose face, be flooded with shame. As the tide rose inside me, I texted a friend “Being Chinese kinda sucks,” then boarded my flight. I was never good at treading water.\n\nThis trip forced me upriver, to the roaring headwater where my shame was born: money. Its absence ripped me away from bonding with family; I saw my relatives just three times in thirty years. Its absence powered abuse at home, leaving bruises in its backwash. Its absence stranded us to low, muddy banks while our wealthier Chinese-American acquaintances enjoyed deeper waters. As an adult, I still ferry my destitute, divorced mom across the shallows, pretending we’re cruising on the American dream. Some say even the poorest can save face through virtue alone, but I’ve only ever seen it be pay-to-play. In China, my mom and I played rich enough; it’s easy to do with exchange rates. We rigged rafts out of lies: my abusive father is “a wonderful husband” and “we visit him in Silicon Valley” and “we still live in that big house.” Among her rich retiree friends and family drawing 10,000+ RMB per month, my minimum-wage mom still managed to stay buoyant. She is quintessentially Chinese in a way that I’m not. For her, keeping up appearances is social glue, not deceit. Layer by layer, she collects the silt of status, securing her shoreline. I drift beside her, half-drowned."}
{"text": "I bought the \"Falling Man\" NFT by Jules after @GameStopNFT delisted it and banned the artist from future minting.\n\nThis NFT inspired a furious media onslaught due to its source material, a disturbing photo of a man who jumped from the Twin Towers on 9/11.\n\nWhy did I buy it?\n\n---\n\n_\"Only a disgusting person would exploit death like this. Shame on you!\"_\n\nDo you know that the original photo inspired the same outrage at first? Richard Drew and his photo _The Falling Man_ were \"denounced as coldblooded, ghoulish and sadistic.\" Even as _The Falling Man_ was harshly criticized, Richard Drew remained steadfast. \n\n> \"I didn't capture this person's death,\" he explains. \"I captured part of his life.\"\n\nToday _The Falling Man_ is known as an artistic masterpiece and \"one of the most perfect photographs ever taken.\" \n\nHistory doesn't repeat; it rhymes.\n\nI bought the \"Falling Man\" NFT because it seized me. I'm moved by its history and what I've discovered about trauma, healing, choice, and identity by exploring this controversy. I'm moved by its future and our future. I'm moved by free speech. When I say free speech, I don't mean in the legal sense. Absent government coercion, @GameStopNFT has the right to remove \"Falling Man\" NFT. \n\nFree speech challenges the lines we draw around what we're allowed to witness. Free speech tests the boundaries of self-censorship.\n\nI'll say more on free speech later. First, I have a confession to make. \n\nBefore this NFT, I had never seen the original _The Falling Man_ photo. \n\nYes, really. I'm an American who has never reckoned with 9/11, until now.\n\nAside from that day where I sat in a classroom, too young to understand the living horror playing out on TV, I've managed to avoid all news related to 9/11. News is propaganda, so I don't consume news. It's one way I protect myself from being manipulated.\n\nNaturally, I missed the news cycle around the \"Falling Man\" NFT. When I learned about it, the NFT was already delisted. And Jules, the first artist I've ever bought an NFT from and who I talked to in private, had gone mute. I wrote about buying from Jules here.\n\nSo when I looked at the \"Falling Man\" NFT, I saw it with fresh eyes. It transported me to a terrible moment: Ad Astra in theaters, 2019. Brad Pitt played Roy McBride, an astronaut sent to the outskirts of our Solar System in search of a father who doesn't love him.\n\nAd Astra triggered such extreme disassociation in me that when I stumbled into the theater bathroom, I couldn't recognize myself in the mirror. My consciousness fled to the backseat of my body. Sounds were blunted. My skin was numb. I felt nothing. I was alone.\n\nThat's what trauma does. It makes you feel isolated. You become your own afterimage, a shadow of the You from Before. Like the original photo, the \"Falling Man\" NFT dances with this familiar shadow. The disorientation, the terror of freefall—it's a haunting image.\n\nBut it didn't only recall trauma for me. I also saw the grace and stillness, the same quietness that so arrested photo editor Naomi Halperin when she viewed the original. The Associated Press ran 170,000 copies of _The Falling Man_ in large print on The Morning Call, one day after 9/11.\n\nThe fury was immediate. People wrote that it was \"stomach punching,\" \"obscene,\" \"taking away the person's humanity,\" \"used in poor judgment.\" _Do not let your children read this paper_ , they said. \n\nAnd no news organization ever ran it in mass again.\n\nFrom this documentary, I learned that _The Falling Man_ inspired more responses than any photo in news organizations' history. In the same breath, it was erased from cultural memory. With it, the ~200 people who jumped from The Twin Towers were also forgotten.\n\nThey were forgotten because their deaths were imperfect. \"No one jumped. We don't say that,\" NY coroners offices said to journalist Tom Junod. \"They were forced.\" \n\nThe possibility of choice was too terrible to consider.\n\n> Some people who look at the picture see stoicism, willpower, a portrait of resignation; others see something else—something discordant and therefore terrible: freedom."}
{"text": "\"Every liberal needs to be strangled\" my mom hisses in Mandarin, fuming as we run late to the 11 a.m. Charlie Kirk memorial I have mixed emotions about. For me, the memorial is…an opportunity? A chance to write about politics and propaganda. A chance to attend Sunday church again. It's been too many years, and now we're gunning towards the service of the century at State Farm Stadium with 100,000 mourners at its wake. But really, it's a chance to hear out Erika Kirk. She is a widow general, the most powerful woman in the world right now. With words, she can lead us to fire and brimstone, to dark paradise. Though I hope she softens the scapegoating. So yes, this is an opportunity of a lifetime, but I'm no craven opportunist. I'm there to see all the circling beasts, all the heady hyenas at this carrion call. My MAGA mom, for one, is out for blood. To her, the Charlie Kirk memorial is simple. Vengeance is a better breakfast than her pears and red-bean bread. Between bites, she continues cursing the left. I roll my eyes. 6:15 a.m. is too early, so I drown her out with Power by Ye on repeat; Charlie's favorite hype song, according to his work wife, Candace Owens. I nod to the lyrics: \"This is way too much, I need a moment.\"\n\n---\n\nAttending this memorial is also some stupid, desperate bid to please my mom. In September, I returned from New York City with zero-carb rice, a gift in answer to her gripes about rice-driven weight gain. But fifteen minutes later, she’s dressed me down to nothing. My sins: I squandered money, wasted time and energy carrying it in my suitcase, and fell for “fake liberal bullshit.” Through furious—and embarrassing—tears, I tried protesting: it was $10, I’m not _that_ weak, and stop mom, it’s literally just food. Then she yelled that nothing I give her could ever match the gift that was Charlie Kirk, which shocked me out of my sobs. _Well alright, chuck the rice into the trash. Let’s go see Charlie_. You see? I’m not some vulture, feasting for spectacle. I’m something even more pathetic, a yelping dog begging for a meager scrap. She thinks if she mewls a little more, her world will change, turn on its axis, show her bright lights, big cities, big dreams. A part of me wants a savior to put Old Yeller out to pasture. Take that thing out of its misery. Just shoot it through the neck. Je suis Charlie Kirk. If you didn’t laugh at my fucked up joke, I’m glad your mom loves you.\n\nWho even was Charlie Kirk? Let’s dissect Charlie Kirk the propagandist, which I don’t mean as an accusation. We need propaganda to survive even when it destroys us, as the prophetic French philosopher and theologian Jacques Ellul would say. Propaganda is what every media scavenger is responding to, after all. Even if you binged over 5,000 hours of Charlie Kirk content, you still wouldn’t know Charlie Kirk the man. I knew of him before his murder, though I never sampled his product. Of the right wing content creators, Candace Owens suits my appetite the most; I like my girls insane. So I get a taste of him now, consuming the way the public consumed him—piecemeal, a Rorschach hors d’oeuvre."}
{"text": "A hedge fund trader taught me how to love. I had no idea what a wretched thing I was, until I met him. We met anonymously on Twitter in early-2022, love at first write. Real love, no min-maxing, no tweaking and twisting bits and pieces of your face and your body and your personality to fit some standard shell. Real love, not market logic. You'd think he'd be some Wall Street wanker, the meanest market machine of all. Always hedging, always derisking. He was __ ruthless at work, no doubt. His mind was a perfect terror, a Turing machine that drew derivatives from mere memory. Only I saw his tenderness, his soul that he poured into me through so many pieces of art and letters. Abstract portraits of me, lyrical little stories, handwritten Valentine's Day cards with poetic flourish. (It's so unfair that one person can hoard all these talents). During our breakup, I started thinking about what I must have cost him. Time he could've spent researching stocks that he spent on me instead. $100,000? $500,000? No, millions upon millions. He would never think this, much less say it. But I must've kept costing him and costing him until I couldn't anymore, until we dissolved.\n\n---\n\nThis year, I searched for art to manage the breakup, at first favoring _Portrait of a Lady on Fire_ where two women who cannot be together remake Orpheus and Eurydice in their image. In the Greek myth, Orpheus descends into the Underworld to retrieve his beloved Eurydice on one condition: he must not look back at her. Just before he breaches the surface, he turns around. A mistake? Maybe. Or maybe Orpheus wanted to look. He wanted the memory over the living reality, and made the poet’s choice, not the lover’s. All good breakups are some flavor of the poet’s choice. We clawed our way through a long, slow, mutual ending, calling it “living in copeland,” the delusional liminal space where we pretended that he hadn’t changed his mind about having children. I think I took it especially hard because, between the two of us, he was always the one so certain about our future, while I was less sure. From the very start, he said we’d always be together. When I had doubts and whispered “Turn around and look at me,” he refused. But I should’ve known better. After all, a trader’s mind cannot see absolutes, only probabilities. He was 99% sure we’d get married, 1% sure he didn’t want children. The percentages flipped slowly, then all at once. One day, he honored my voice. He turned around to look at me one last time. And that was that. Love was behind us. Gone. Orpheus with his lyre in the land of the living, Eurydice lost to the hollow Underworld.\n\nI searched for more means to cope and seized upon a different piece of Greek mythos, love interpreted in _Eros the Bittersweet_ by Anne Carson. As Sappho says, Eros is _glukupikron_ : bittersweet, better translated as sweetbitter. It lives in paradox, in the shape of a triangle between the lover, beloved, and the distance between them. Love is a contradictory desire, like hunger. Once you eat the food, you cease to be hungry. Once the person you love becomes one with you, then they cease to exist as a desired other. “Whoever desires what is not gone? No one.” There’s science behind this ancient instinct; desire needs distance to stay alive. Collapse distance into familiarity, and love dies a thermal death: no risk, no novelty, no imagination. Collapse the triangle, and Eros suffocates in safety. Only in the absent-present can Eros breathe. This interpretation comforted me, knowing that I keep him by not having him, that I can make both the lover’s choice and the poet’s choice at the same time."}
{"text": "\"Nuclear war is good because it ends life, which is suffering\" punched me in the throat. The first time I heard it, my words tangled in my mouth, caught behind my teeth. I had no response.\n\nOver time, I learned to roll with the hits. It sounds like it crawled out from deep inside an irony poisoned 4chan thread, but it is actually a serious argument for serious people.\n\nWelcome to anti-natalism, where life is so awful that it is better never to be born. A theory used to defend nuclear war. A fringe idea for fringe nerds, like me—a former policy debater. To my suicidal teenage self, the idea that it was cruel to bring life into the world felt oddly comforting. It affirmed the death I felt inside.\n\nToday, it is a cold comfort at best. For the first time in 31 years, I am entertaining switching sides, just like I did in debate.\n\nI am considering becoming someone's mother. How terrifying.\n\n---\n\nMy early twenties were terrible, especially in romance. Partly because I was a mess, partly because I was recovering from being an argumentative asshole, and partly because every relationship was a nonstarter after I dropped the childfree bomb. Even the women I dated wanted kids. Just my luck; all the queers are heteronormative. Where are the 44% of people who don’t want children? I was ready to give up and take it a step further as a single, childless AND cat-free lady. \n\nThen in my late twenties, I randomly, _finally_ met a man who didn’t want kids. But between the two of us, I was the one truly childfree. My shitty, stressful childhood gifted me with an autoimmune disease, making pregnancies higher risk. And the silence of my biological clock lingers—an absence I can’t escape. \n\nMy now ex was reluctantly childfree. For reasons I won’t get into publicly, he recently changed his mind. Now he wants a gaggle of sweet kids running about a midcentury house. I should have seen it coming. After all, I chose the human version of switch-side debate. “Whiplash” is his name on my phone. My whip smart sweetheart gave me whiplash once again. \n\nBut maybe, just maybe, I’m the one who will whip around this time. Love could be the activation energy that moves my mind. \n\nI poured that new vigor into a strange new world. Despite being childfree, I had not actively engaged with childfree content before. So I dove deep into online childfree communities, listened to podcasts like _DINKY_ , and read _Regretting Motherhood_ by Orna Donath.\n\nOn the flip side, I asked friends for their parenting stories, learned how children learn, attended my first baby shower, and made crafts with millennial mothers. \n\nBaby shower block painting party! I made (K)isses and (L)ove for little James, due late November\n\nIn short, I did what I do best: ignored my emotions, disappeared into my head, and gathered evidence for the greatest debate round of my life. _Resolved: I should have children because I will enjoy motherhood_. Easy enough. I negate the resolution: stay childfree because I will regret motherhood but won’t regret non-motherhood.\n\nBut the evidence was sparse. I could easily find regretful parenting stories, no problem. But do people who choose NOT to have kids regret it? As taboo as it is to regret parenthood, it seems even more taboo to say you chose to be childfree and then regretted it decades later. My generation is also likely the first where foregoing children became a widespread, real choice — the data simply isn’t there yet. \n\nWithout good data and studies, I tried another strategy. I negate the resolution: having children is selfish, horrible for the environment, and destructive in a hundred ways.\n\n _A sure win_ , I thought. All the evidence is in childfree communities. My people.\n\nBut I found myself grimacing. Turns out that David Benatar, father of anti-natalism, is practically a household name with 225,000 devotees. Not such a fringe idea after all. And with 1.5 million subscribers, the main childfree forum fared no better. I like children, so the nasty language used to describe them stunned me: _crotch goblins_ and _parasites_ and _spawn_. \n\nAt baseline, it made more sense to view having children as a neutral stance. People must reproduce to continue existing. It is neither good nor bad. It just is."}
