{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hero worship isn’t in my wiring. But reading and learning about the polymathic French philosopher, sociologist, Nazi Resistance fighter, and Christian anarchist Jacques Ellul comes pretty close. I finally understood the banality of evil upon hearing Ellul recall the Nuremberg trials. The head of camp Bergen-Belsen was asked if it was horrible, overseeing so many corpses. He had replied: _“What could I do? The capacity of the ovens was too small…I had no time to think about those people. I was too busy with that technical problem of my ovens._ ” Violence was a technical malfunction, atrocity a throughput issue. Ellul saw the hidden disease in that response: where efficiency lives, responsibility dies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In two of his most famous yet underrated works, The Technological Society (1954), which I’ve just started reading, and Propaganda: The Formation of Men’s Attitudes (1962), which I read two months ago, Ellul conducts a cold autopsy of modernity. With surgical precision, he clarified the confusions I've carried for years, from when I both spread and suffered from propaganda. Ellul gave me the words I lacked. His prescient insight: propaganda is a powerful form of technology, what he called _technique_ —the logic of efficiency. Propaganda is the technique of conformity: it integrates us into technological society at the low, low cost of our agency. If violence is a mere byproduct of a technical system we conform to, then no one is responsible, since no one makes choices. And if no one makes choices, then no one is free. Through efficiency and conformity, we’re made to feel free. But in reality, modernity has robbed us of freedom with no force at all.\n\n## Technique: The Infection called Efficiency\n\nA spectre haunts modernity. Many have spoken of it: Vervaeke’s meaning crisis, Foucault and Orwell’s biopolitical surveillance, Weber’s disenchanted world, Marx’s alienation by capitalism, Nietzsche’s mournful cry “God is dead.” But you don’t need to be a great thinker to feel sick. You might intuit that technology has something to do with the brainrot, the loneliness, the tribalism. Yet we’re still mired in a tired debate about technology: it is either good or bad or—if you fancy nuance—neutral (“it depends on who owns it”). Optimists see technology as the inevitable march towards progress, while doomers see it as a harbinger of dystopia. The nuanced could love autonomous driving but hate Elon Musk, so Waymo it is. And since Zuckerberg is an alien wearing a human suit, maybe we shouldn’t let him “move fast and break things.” In the end, we wring our hands and say, technology has granted us so much, but there’s some bad excess. It lurks in the allure of the algorithm, so let’s try to tame the beast. All we have to do is delete TikTok. All we have to do is write without AI. All we have to do is keep a watchful eye on the devil, and all will be cured.\n\nWhether technology is savior or villain or neither misses the scope of Ellul’s much larger, darker diagnosis: we have been infected with the machine logic of efficiency applied everywhere to everything. We suffer from Technology with a capital T, or the poorly translated concept of _technique_ , the broader driving force behind technology (etymologically, technology means “the study of technique”). Skeptics say, we have always used techniques to transform the world. Which is true. However, in pre-modern times, techniques served human ends, such as ritual and worship of God and nature. But modernity, which has profaned and desacralized the natural world and God, has elevated technique to the sacred instead. Deprived of our fundamental needs for connection with nature, one another, and the sacred, we turn to even more techniques as substitutes. Even if we set aside the gadgets and gears, less visible forms of technique thrive: doctors prescribe pills to return people to productivity, McKinsey consultants distill decisions to KPI dashboards, marketers create copy for clicks and conversions, educators teach to the test. Every field, institution, community, and relationship across the globe is invaded by technique, even our most intimate selves. How many of us dress up our dating profiles? Polish our LinkedIn pages? Leverage “life hacks” in our lives? Search, scour, scramble for the “one best way” to be?\n\nTechnique hijacked us, a mechanical parasite with a life of its own, engineering us to its own ends. We do what It needs; we dot our pale blue dot with datacenters for AI; we contort our cities for cars; we break our backs for the clock. Technique thinks in binaries; 0s and 1s; it either works or it doesn’t. It is ambivalent to wisdom, beauty, justice—silly human values and goals. Whether technique is good or evil is irrelevant; technique does not dream of morals. It does not ask _why_ it should be done, only that it _must be done_. Technique fragments life into tasks that must be done, each one rational, efficient, utilitarian. Everyone responds to their task, and no one is responsible for the whole. Each of us can chant _I had to_ : the engineer only designed the ovens, the conductor only directed the trains, the bureaucrat only signed the orders. Yet these meek protests reveal the paradox. If something is necessary, can we choose it? If we cannot choose, can we be responsible? Ellul’s sobering story of Bergen-Belsen makes his point clear. The officer with his feeble bleating “ _What could I do_?” tried to deny his responsibility, but his very denial affirmed it. The technician did the task he needed to do, and he thought necessity would absolve him. Make no mistake: we always have a choice. We choose to evade choice. We choose to worship technique. We choose to efficiently eliminate our humanity. Like the officer, we’ve become too busy with the technical problem of our ovens to stop the sickening stench, to protest the “transformation of the entire nation into a concentration camp.” When Ellul cuts open modernity, he sees almost no blood. There’s hardly anything human anymore among all the wires.\n\n## Propaganda: The Mutation called Conformity\n\nThe most sinister, secretive, and paradoxical of all techniques is propaganda. Unlike technology, whose virtues and vices are endlessly debated, propaganda is rarely thought of as a _technique_ at all. We see it as a necessary tool when wielded by democracies, pure evil when perfected by the Nazis. Even Ellul nearly fell prey to its monstrous, most obvious form. Once, out of morbid curiosity, Ellul attended a Nazi rally. Despite his convictions, the feverish crowd nearly seduced him. His arm almost rose in salute. _Almost._ That near-betrayal of his beliefs shatters the popular perception of propaganda. It is not persuasive brainwashing, but something far more insidious, possessive, bone-deep. Other academic theories only gesture at its nature. Walter Lippman, father of journalism, bowed to necessity: propaganda is a neutral, practical way to manufacture consent in a complex society. Noam Chomsky, father of linguistics, flipped the script on Lippman: propaganda may be necessary, but never neutral when it destroys dissent as the instrument of powerful institutions. Edward Bernays, father of public relations, waxed rather naive poetic: propaganda is not only necessary, but good when it serves the truth. Only Ellul dissected propaganda to reveal its true face: the technique of conformity. If technique is an infection that erases responsibility, propaganda is its most advanced mutation: it erases agency, leaving us incapable of choosing responsibility.\n\nPropaganda has found the “one best way” to make us conform to a technological society. Daily we wade through the flood of headlines, the 24/7 hum of Slacks and sermons, the gossip from our neighbors, the texts from our friends, the pings from our bosses, the cries of our children, the loss of our lovers. Time, space, and energy evaporate; we have nothing left for reflection. Enter propaganda to replace reflection with reflex, letting us adapt neatly into our lives with pre-fabricated parroting. Propaganda has one chief desire: to make people act in a pre-ordained accordance. It will search for the most efficient idea, slogan, myth to make us act out of reflex, exploiting lies, half-truths, and most often the full truth. It need not persuade, though it can. We act, then find reasons to excuse the act. Belief follows action, and with it, we complete the cycle at last, smiling as we join the technological society. Propaganda then, is not only a technique because it joins the techniques of mass media and behavioral science in unholy matrimony. It is a technique because it efficiently exploits our need to manage modernity in all its overwhelm. And it is the most dangerous technique of all; most of them still leave some blood in us, but propaganda drains the rest. It takes away agency, the possibility of choice, of taking responsibility, and refines it into crude oil. Propaganda “solves the problem of man,” completing our transformation into automatons, unblinking, unthinking, unseeing. In turning man into machine, propaganda reveals its totalitarian essence. We are trapped in a paradox: we need propaganda to survive, but we cannot live with propaganda.\n\nPropaganda has also found the “one best way” to hide itself, rerouting what remains of our immune response towards scapegoats instead of the infection. During COVID-19, I opted out of the vaccine. I had calculated my own risk-benefit ratio, given a pre-existing autoimmune condition, and decided to chance the disease instead of the vaccine. But propaganda cannot tolerate individual judgment; opting out is an illusion. Decades-long friends flaunted their vaccine passports, approving my segregation from polite society. My fellow Bernie Sanders-supporting, Medicare-for-All friends told me to just _fucking die alone already_ ; hospitals aren’t for “Republican conspiracy theorists” like me. I no longer saw myself reflected in their black eyes; I was nobody, nothing, a nefarious thing, the nemesis of all that was good and pure. I turned to leftist thinkers for mercy, and found no one aside from Agamben. Even the great critic of propaganda and anarchist Chomsky, who I owed my belief that all news is propaganda, supported keeping filth like me from grocery stores. For the first time, I keenly felt the ways in which so-called “democratic propaganda,” made in service of the truth and public health, destroyed the values of democracy. I finally understood how propaganda could redirect resentment towards ready-made enemies: Jews, the bourgeoisie, MAGA deplorables, homosexuals, the globalists, the unvaccinated. Against any Other, propaganda can make cruelty a moral right, violence a virtue. And yet, as long as even one drop of blood remains, there is still a chance to exercise agency. There is still a chance to resist propaganda. \n\n## Forgotten Prophecies: Anti-Memes Resist Spread\n\nI accidentally struck a gold vein when I found Ellul’s ideas, but it’s strange that I had never heard of him before. Four years I spent as a policy debater mining obscure philosophy, yet I never surfaced him. Other thinkers far eclipsed him in fame for similar criticisms of technology and violence. For instance, I cited Heidegger’s The Question Concerning Technology in debates, a critique published the same year as Ellul’s The Technological Society. While Heidegger’s Nazi affiliation did little to slow his fame, Ellul has eluded me until now; quite a mystery. Why did other peoples’ ideas spread, but not Ellul’s? To answer the question, I borrow from René Girard, a scholar famous for his theory of mimetics. According to Girard, we don’t just want things—we want what others want. Desire itself is contagious. Rivalry over scarce objects of desire escalates into conflict, spreading violence like a plague that can only be contained through sacrificing scapegoats. Memes may work the same way. When we share a viral meme, the idea is less important than the belonging it signals. Ideas spread because they mark us as part of the right tribe, the cool kids club. Almost anything can become a meme—even death itself, as in the documented phenomenon of suicide clusters.\n\nBut there is a type of idea that cannot easily spread. Anti-memes are consequential truths that resist replication because they are too uncomfortable to circulate. Ellul’s ideas belong here. He cut modernity to the bone, but his critiques ask for too much. They ask readers to face their own complicity. They ask readers to wrestle with contradictions and paradoxes: technology is empowering and enslaving; propaganda is necessary and destructive; violence is natural and unacceptable. Contradiction creates no enemies to fight, no slogans to chant. This is nearly impossible to tribalize, let alone monetize. By contrast, Girard’s mimetic theory traveled far because it was memetic in itself. Girard’s protege Peter Thiel invested in Facebook because he foresaw how the platform would amplify mimetic rivalry. Ellul’s work offers no such great investment strategy. And the great irony? Ellul and Girard admired each other. Both defied the fashions of the French intelligentsia. Both diagnosed problems of violence. Both found no answers to violence against human dignity in the material world, only the spiritual. But Girard’s ideas spread because they explained violence cleanly, while Ellul’s ideas saw a different fate. Perhaps Ellul is forever doomed to echo Kierkegaard, one of his greatest influences. Kierkegaard was “another voice raised in prophetic warning against [technique], but his warnings…were not heeded. They were too close to the truth.”\n\n## The Forgotten Prophet: A World without an Exit?\n\nIf Ellul’s prognosis—that entire nations are now concentration camps—strikes you as grim hyperbole, relax. He says that the truth is bleaker yet: \n\n> “It will not be a universal concentration camp, because it will be guilty of no atrocity. It will not be insane, because everything will be ordered…We shall have nothing more to lose, and nothing to win…We shall be rewarded with everything our hearts ever desired. And the supreme luxury of the society of technical necessity will be to grant the bonus of useless revolt and of an acquiescent smile.”\n\nIf this description rings a bell, you may be recalling Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World (1932). His dystopia was not terror, but anesthetized pleasure—a hazy, docile world of people sated by soma, sex, and distraction. It’s no wonder, then, that Huxley championed Ellul for English publication, saying that Ellul “made the case” that he had sketched out in fiction. Thanks to Huxley’s intervention, Ellul avoided total obscurity. Once translated into English, Ellul’s influence began to seep out in shadowy, indirect ways. He surfaced in entire fields, such as communication theory through celebrated names such as Neil Postman of Amusing Ourselves to Death (1985) and Marshall McLuhan, the father of media studies. Ellul’s strangest and most infamous claim to fame came through the notorious Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, who grotesquely misread Ellul’s work, twisting his writings of nonviolence to justify violence. \n\nWhile it’s tempting to label Ellul a fatal pessimist, he wasn’t one at all. He believed this was a “world without an exit,” yes, but he also believed in the Kingdom of God. Ellul’s pessimism lived in his sociology and philosophy, and his optimism in his theology. I certainly appreciated his jolly optimism in his interviews, where he spoke of his love of poetry and music, all while rummaging through towers of books and papers only rivaled by his towering intellect. But what about hope for nonbelievers? For them, Ellul offered modest means of resistance: cultivate awareness, reclaim responsibility, slow down so that wisdom can reassert itself over reflex, and refuse the false substitutes of technique. We can act opposite of that camp guard, making time to think about people as people, not inputs for machines. It’s not easy; even Ellul, who resisted propaganda, couldn’t resist technique. He was no Luddite, and he lived like a machine himself, grinding through ten-hour workdays. So let’s be clear: these are not cures. They are therapies for a sickness that may never leave us.\n\nI can’t pretend I’m not infected. Technique has hijacked me as well. For instance, I use AI every day, even to write this very essay. Perhaps I shouldn’t, in honor of Ellul. Maybe you’ll accept my meager consolation: I take AI as a bitter medicine, not as an efficiency pill—I use AI to write much, much slower. It becomes a dialogue partner, not a shortcut. It helps me think through structures, layers, paradoxes, contradictions. It helps me reflect on the fidelity of each phrase I put to paper. But even if my writing process is inefficient, I often wonder if the end result embodies the ultimate form of technique. I worry that I am spreading propaganda, as I did in the past. Is every Note and every essay just another easy, digestible package delivered to your feed, telling you what to do? My answer, I think, is no. Propaganda thrives on reflex; paradox resists it. Wrestling with hard ideas is my inoculation, my refusal to find the “one best way,” my small rebellion against technique. And my invitation to you, the reader, is reason, argument, dialogue, debate—but also to feeling, laughter and grief and sweetness, all the sugary, spicy warts that make us human. If we share just one drop of blood, we return to being more than just machines. Maybe I’d be less of one now, if I had found Ellul sooner. But perhaps I only received his diagnosis once I was ready to see the wires."}]}

Incredible choice to introduce a clan of Fire Paganists who've left God/Eywa and then have them do nothing in the last third.\n\nStill, blockbusters rarely surprise me, yet James Cameron managed to do it with the Fire suicide bomber. At that scene, my Chinese mom turned to me and whispered knowingly, \"Ah, they're Japanese!\" (The white liberal mind cannot comprehend the enmity between ethnic minorities.)\n\nMy main critique of the last third is that it was boring, since it repeated the fight climaxes from both part 1 and part 2. I would've preferred something daring. If Cameron was more of a risk-taking auteur, he should've forced us to watch whale genocide. Have the Tulkuns decide they'd rather keep their culture of nonviolence even in the face of annihilation. No self-defense. Not even when it's necessary. They'd become true Christ-like figures and open up immense dialogue.\n\nAlso, the ethical dilemma vis-a-vis humans vs Na'vi isn't fully explored, since humans are painted indisputably as The Bad Guys. In reality, Cameron is asking the audience to cheer for the self-genocide (anthropocide? omnicide?) of humanity. In this universe, people already killed their mother Earth and are searching for a new home as space-navigators, so the Na'vi winning likely means the total destruction of the human species. Maybe the next installment(s) will address this?\n\nFinally, I did appreciate an Old Testament scene in the last third.
