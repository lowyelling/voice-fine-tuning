I'm very happy to announce my first book "What We Do" has been optioned! This is something I've been wanting to do for years. The book will be a collection of short stories inspired by the characters in my novels. It's going to be a fun read, and I hope you'll all support it! I think you're all going to love it as much as I do.

Also, I'm excited to say that my second novel "The Last Ones" has been optioned by a company called "Penguin Random House" (for non-US territories). Their goal is to produce and publish short fiction in their "World Fantasy" imprint.

And finally, I just published a blog post here about why I write books instead of poems. Check it out if you haven't yet: http://michaelkaltenbach.com/2014/07/why-i-write-books-instead-of-poems/. And thanks so much to everyone who commented and shared it with their friends!

Now I'm off to write more books! Thanks again for reading and being a part of my journey!

Alyssa Liu

Age: 29

City: Berkeley, CA

Occupation: Senior Product Manager, Twitter

Education: UC Berkeley, BS Economics, MS Computer Science

Liu is a Chinese American woman who was born to an immigrant mother and white father. Her parents brought her to America when she was two years old. She moved back to China when she was 13, and then lived in Hong Kong until she returned to the U.S. when she was 20. Liu graduated with honors from the University of California San Diego with a degree in economics and minored in computer science. She also won a silver medal as part of the 2012 U.S. Snowboard Team at the Olympics.

Her first job out of college was at Twitter as a product manager. After several months of working on the company's product team, she left to pursue her professional goals. She now leads engineering efforts for the company's search engine.

On Facebook, she's active on the social media platform's "Women Who Code" page. In July, she became a mentor to the inaugural class of the Women Who Code program, which offers women the opportunity to learn about coding by being taught by the best coders in the business.

"The most important thing that I've learned is how to be a leader," Liu told Quartz in an interview. "I want to be the person who inspires other people."

She said she feels a sense of pride every time she puts on her skis to ski down a hill or goes for a run. "You know, I don't even think about it, but I'm actually really proud of who I am," Liu added.

Liu has been in the public eye since she was featured in The New York Times, where she wrote a piece called "It's All About Me." She also has a number of viral videos on YouTube, including a skydiving one in 2013.
