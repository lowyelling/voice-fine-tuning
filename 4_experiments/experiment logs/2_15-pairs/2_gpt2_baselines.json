    "\nI'm very happy to announce my first book \"What We Do\" has been optioned! This is something I've been wanting to do for years. The book will be a collection of short stories inspired by the characters in my novels. It's going to be a fun read, and I hope you'll all support it! I think you're all going to love it as much as I do.\n\nAlso, I'm excited to say that my second novel \"The Last Ones\" has been optioned by a company called \"Penguin Random House\" (for non-US territories). Their goal is to produce and publish short fiction in their \"World Fantasy\" imprint.\n\nAnd finally, I just published a blog post here about why I write books instead of poems. Check it out if you haven't yet: http://michaelkaltenbach.com/2014/07/why-i-write-books-instead-of-poems/. And thanks so much to everyone who commented and shared it with their friends!\n\nNow I'm off to write more books! Thanks again for reading and being a part of my journey!",
