    "I am not just another statistic in the American education system; I am the face of its failures and successes.\n\nAs a Chinese first-generation immigrant, my parents worked tirelessly to send me to college. But our reality is far different from that of middle-class white Americans. My parents couldn't afford private schools or tutors for me, so I was forced to attend underfunded public schools in a predominantly low-income area.\n\nNow, as I navigate college life, I see that the American education system fails many students like me who are born into poverty or come from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The wealthy have access to resources they can't even imagine, while those like us struggle to make ends meet.\n\nIt's heartbreaking when you see talented, hardworking students dropping out due to financial difficulties. It breaks your heart because we know they could have been game-changers in their respective fields.\n\nBut it also infuriates me to see the privileged classes claiming that everyone has equal opportunities in this country. They claim that if we work hard enough, we'll be able to achieve anything. But what does \"work hard\" mean when you're struggling to make ends meet? What does \"equal opportunity\" look like when the playing field is stacked against you?\n\nThey say that education is the key to success, but what about those of us who can't afford textbooks, let alone laptops and internet? How do we succeed with such an uneven playing field?\n\nWe must fight for change in this broken system, one that takes advantage of the most vulnerable members of society. We need to break down barriers and create more equitable pathways for students from all walks of life.\n\nThis fight is far from over, but it's time to speak up and demand justice.",
    "As I sit here in my parents' living room surrounded by the remnants of our dinner - takeout containers and discarded chopsticks - I am reminded of the sacrifices they made for me to be here.\n\nMy dad used to wake up at 5am every day to drive an Uber. He'd come home at night exhausted but still somehow find energy to cook us dinner and help with homework. My mom would work two jobs just so she could afford to send me to private school. They barely spoke English when we arrived in this country, but their children's education was all that mattered to them.\n\nI'm grateful for the opportunities this country has given me, but it's hard not to feel like I've failed them. I'm working two jobs too now, barely scraping by on my freelance income as a writer. The thought of starting over again from scratch, working multiple jobs to make ends meet, it keeps me up at night.\n\nBut what really gets to me is how hard it is to break free from the cycle of poverty. Even if you're the most hardworking person alive, there are just so many barriers stacked against you. Housing costs, student loans, healthcare - it's like there's no way out no matter how hard you try.\n\nI think about all the people who came before me, people who fought for their rights, who sacrificed everything for their families. And yet here I am, still struggling to make ends meet. It feels like no matter how much we push, we'll never truly be free.\n\nAnd then I think about my parents. They didn't have the same privileges I did, but they worked twice as hard. They risked everything to give me a better life. If I can do half as well as they did, maybe that's enough. Maybe that's enough to say I'm succeeding.\n\nBut even that feels like a lie. Success is relative, isn't it? And the truth is, I don't know what success looks like anymore. Is it being able to pay off your own student loans? Being able to afford a house without taking out another mortgage? Being able to send your kids to college without crippling yourself?\n\nThe American Dream is a myth, isn't it? A cruel joke played on immigrants like me who will always be chasing something just out of reach. Or maybe it's just a dream I've been sold, one I've bought into hook, line, and sinker.\n\nI don't know what the answer is, but I do know one thing - I won't stop fighting. For myself, for my family, for all those who came before me. Even if the odds are against us, even if it seems impossible, we keep pushing forward because we know that's all we can do.\n\nI guess that's the beauty of hope. Hope doesn't care about facts or statistics. It only cares about whether you believe in yourself.\n\nSo yeah, I'll keep hoping. I'll keep fighting. Even if it kills me. Because the alternative is to give up. To accept defeat. And I'd rather die trying than live knowing I gave up.\n\nTo my readers, I'm sorry for rambling on like this. But I needed to get this out. To anyone else who's feeling stuck, trapped, hopeless - I see you. I hear you. We're in this together.\n\nIf you want to support me, you can buy me a coffee here or follow me on social media here.\n\nThanks for reading, everyone!",
    "My mom, who never graduated college, works three jobs to make ends meet and still manages to send me to an elite high school. Meanwhile, my classmates are born with silver spoons in their mouths, attending private schools since they were toddlers.\n\nI used to believe I was one of them, that I deserved every privilege I've ever had. But now I see how ridiculous that sounds. My parents' hard work isn't just for themselves; it's for me. They're constantly making sacrifices so I can live a better life.\n\nNow that I'm on the other side of privilege, watching people struggle just to pay rent or get by, I realize how delusional I was. I thought I was the only one working hard because everyone around me seemed to be coasting. But no, they're all fighting just as hard as I am.\n\nThe truth is, this country doesn't care about me, even if I have a good education. It won't protect me when I graduate unless I'm already white or rich. And if I'm not, then I'm just another disposable immigrant, a replacement worker.\n\nThis is what America does best: divide us. It pits us against each other, makes us hate our own families and communities, so we don't notice the real enemy: the system itself.\n\nBut I know the truth. The system is what keeps us poor, what keeps us marginalized. It tells us that we deserve to suffer for being \"lazy\" or \"undeserving,\" but really, we're just pawns in a game designed to keep us down.\n\nSo I'll stop playing along. I'll stop pretending like I'm part of this privileged club. I'll stop believing the lies this country feeds me.\n\nAnd you know what? You should too.\n\nDon't trust anyone who tells you you're alone, who tells you there's something wrong with you.\n\nYou're not alone.\nYou're not worthless.\nYou're not lazy.\nYou're just poor, and you deserve better.\n\nFight back.\nRefuse to let them break your spirit.\nDemand justice.\nDemand equality.\nDemand freedom.\n\nYou are worthy of everything.\n\n-Your friend",
    "Class in America is weird to me because even though I'm a part of an immigrant community, it's not really relatable.\n\nMy parents came here for work and sacrificed everything to make us comfortable. We live in a suburban house with a lawn, they drive newer cars, we have savings accounts.\n\nBut when people ask what my \"background\" or \"hustle\" is, they're really asking how much money I'm making.\n\nI've never had to hustle like that, because my parents did it all for me. But now I'm paying them back by working too hard.\n\nIt feels like there are only two classes: rich people who don't work and poor people who do. \n\nAs someone stuck in the middle, I just want to be able to relax, take a break, enjoy life without being seen as weak or lazy. But society doesn't let me.\n\nAnd on top of that, I'm still figuring out my identity outside of my family name. It's scary to realize that if I wasn't Chinese, would I still be in this same position? Would I still have this same struggle?\n\nAmerica is a place where you can reinvent yourself, but you also have to fit into a certain mold or else you'll get left behind. That's not freedom, that's pressure.\n\nI'm still trying to find my own path, one that balances taking care of myself while also taking care of others. Maybe then I can finally breathe easy, without the weight of expectation crushing me down.\n\nWhat do you think about class in America? Do you feel like you're caught between two worlds? Share your thoughts below!",
    "**Class in America**\n\nI've been thinking a lot about class lately, and I'm struck by how it seems to be one of those topics that everyone is always talking about but nobody really wants to confront head-on. It's like we're all secretly hoping that if we ignore it long enough, it'll just go away.\n\nBut it won't.\n\nAs an immigrant kid growing up in a lower-middle-class household, I've seen firsthand what class can do to people. My parents are constantly stressed out about money; they worry that they won't be able to afford college for me or my siblings. They work multiple jobs just to make ends meet, often sacrificing time with us as a family so they can provide for our future. And when I see them struggle, I feel guilty because I don't want to burden them further. But I also feel angry because I know I deserve better than this.\n\nMy friends who come from wealthier families? They're often oblivious to the struggles of others. They're too busy enjoying their privilege to even think about the fact that some people have to sacrifice their own happiness for a chance at success.\n\nIt's not that I hate them or anything. I just wish they could see the world through different eyes for once. To understand that class isn't just something you're born into - it's something that can either lift you up or hold you back.\n\nWe need to talk more about class in America. We need to confront the systemic inequalities that keep people trapped in poverty, unable to climb the social ladder no matter how hard they try. We need to dismantle the notion that meritocracy is real and that anyone can succeed with hard work alone.\n\nAnd most importantly, we need to recognize that class affects every single one of us. Whether you're poor, middle-class, or rich, class touches your life in ways you might not even realize.\n\nSo let's talk about it. Let's break down the barriers that separate us and bring us closer together. Let's create a society where everyone has access to resources, education, and opportunities regardless of their zip code or bank account.\n\nLet's fight for a classless America. Or, at the very least, let's start fighting for a more honest conversation about class."

    "Two women who skated to different kinds of gold.\n\nEileen Gu and Alyssa Liu, two snow queens born out of Bay Area sunshine, bound together by their own singular experiences, yet so vastly different in their paths after Olympic triumphs.\n\nEileen has already started writing her next chapter as a Stanford student\u2014between classes, she's built an empire with a billion followers across Weibo, Instagram, TikTok and X; she\u2019s made over $1 million just through ads alone, and now she\u2019s launching her own app.\n\nAlyssa, on the other hand, seems to have vanished from the internet. She\u2019s still competing professionally, but you won\u2019t find her on social media anymore, because it\u2019s too much work, and that takes away from actual training time. The thing is, she\u2019s not just competing, she\u2019s trying to win again, which means she can\u2019t afford to lose any more hours in front of a screen.\n\nI know this feeling well. Sometimes I wonder how people can handle the constant pressure, especially when they\u2019re alone, like Alyssa. But then I think about all the times my mom had to carry me on her shoulders, and there aren\u2019t enough words to describe the kind of weight she felt. \n\nWe don\u2019t talk about the emotional labor of being a single mother, or the strain of raising a child conceived via anonymous egg donation, where you must navigate your identity as a solo parent, biracial family, and surrogate mother. It\u2019s impossible to put into words, but it feels like being held underwater.\n\nAnd I realize that maybe Alyssa isn\u2019t vanishing from public view; she\u2019s escaping. And Eileen is maximizing her influence. Two different ways of surviving.\n\nEileen is a product of the system; she was groomed since childhood to be a superstar athlete, sponsored by Chinese state media and backed by a network of powerful men who saw a winning formula in her mix of Asian beauty standards, whiteness, and athleticism. Now she\u2019s reaping the benefits and playing the game, building her own brand, and getting paid handsomely for her posts.\n\nAlyssa is breaking free from the same system. She didn\u2019t compete for China, and she\u2019s not going back. For the first time in her life, she can finally make choices based on what she wants, rather than what someone else demands of her.\n\nIt\u2019s funny how we talk about \u201cfreeing\u201d ourselves from societal expectations, but it\u2019s actually about embracing them instead, even if it kills us. Because that\u2019s the only way we can truly break free.\n\nAnd now, I see myself in Alyssa\u2019s silence. My life was forever changed when I realized that the only reason why I wasn\u2019t content was because I wasn\u2019t allowed to grieve my dad\u2019s death, my mum\u2019s pain, my loss of innocence. I had to choose between keeping his memory alive or letting go of him entirely, and I chose to let go. \n\nBut even though I\u2019m choosing not to die inside every day, I feel trapped in my body, in my life. I am suffocating under the weight of expectations, even my own. My mother wants me to get married, have kids, keep our family line going; I want to write, travel, love without boundaries, be free.\n\nFreedom feels like dying inside, slowly. It feels like suffocation.\n\nI think about Alyssa and Eileen, two women who rose above the rest, yet are living such vastly different lives. One woman is living her dream, the other is breaking free from her nightmare.\n\nWhich one would I want to be?\n\nThe one who died inside slowly? Or the one who died inside quickly?\n\nI don\u2019t know the answer yet.\n\nFor now, I\u2019ll follow Alyssa\u2019s lead and take the path of least resistance. I\u2019ll stay quiet, and die inside slowly.\n\nMaybe someday I\u2019ll break free, and my voice will shake the world.\n\nOr maybe I\u2019ll never leave my cage.\n\nEither way, I know one thing for sure: it hurts less to watch others escape.",

Meanwhile Eileen won three golds in freestyle skiing in Beijing and has since dropped out of school to pursue her influencer career at Stanford full time. Her YouTube channel now has millions of followers and she's reportedly making six figures per post.\n\nWhat really gets me though is how these two women are total opposites despite having basically identical life circumstances. Alyssa chose a path that prioritizes her sport over her business and has taken a step back from social media altogether. Eileen chose a path where she leverages her beauty and charm to make bank online.\n\nIt's funny how we often romanticize \"following your passion\" when it comes to entrepreneurship or art, but what if we're just following our ego? What if we're only driven by the desire to prove ourselves worthy? We can't let our self-worth depend solely on external validation. \n\nMeanwhile, Alyssa is taking care of herself, doing what truly nourishes her and putting her mental health first. She's not sacrificing anything - she's gaining everything. That's true wealth, not some six-figure check."

    "Jacques Ellul was a French philosopher, sociologist, and theologian whose work focused on the dangers of modern technology and the dehumanizing effects of industrialized society. In his book \"Propaganda,\" Ellul critiques the ways in which societies use various forms of media to shape public opinion and create a false sense of reality. Through his critique, Ellul identifies key mechanisms by which propaganda operates and challenges readers to consider their own role within this system.\n\nEllul argues that people today live under a sort of inverted totalitarianism, where they are free from external control yet still controlled by internal forces. He describes how individuals succumb to the mass culture created by media outlets, who in turn shape popular opinion through subtle suggestions rather than outright lies. This is possible because our entire lives revolve around advertising and consumption; we buy what is advertised to us, so those who have access to the airwaves get to tell us what's worth buying. They dictate the terms of the marketplace, thus dictating our desires and actions.\n\nEllul emphasizes the fact that propaganda can occur even when its messages appear neutral or positive. The most effective propaganda is often disguised as news, as people tend to trust information presented in a straightforward way. When information is given with the veneer of objectivity, it is much more likely to be believed and acted upon. For example, if a company produces ads touting the benefits of their products without mentioning any negative consequences, many consumers will buy into these claims and become customers. This form of propaganda can be incredibly powerful and long-lasting.\n\nEllul also explores the relationship between democracy and propaganda. He notes that in a democratic society, citizens must make informed decisions based on accurate information. Propaganda undermines this goal by creating a false narrative that influences how people vote and act. This creates a paradox: the more open and free a society is, the more susceptible it is to manipulation. Those in power benefit greatly from this dynamic, as they can maintain control over others while appearing to grant them freedom.\n\nIn addition to critiquing propaganda itself, Ellul examines the psychological dynamics behind its effectiveness. People naturally want to belong and avoid conflict, so they seek out information that confirms their existing worldview and avoid challenging ideas that contradict it. This phenomenon is known as \"motivated reasoning.\" As a result, people may be more resistant to change even when faced with facts or evidence against their position, making them easier to manipulate. Ellul suggests that those who recognize and challenge these dynamics are rare, but they play a crucial role in protecting democratic societies from the influence of propaganda.\n\nAs a thinker on the intersection of technology and humanity, Ellul also touches on the concept of alienation. He argues that people in industrialized societies are increasingly disconnected from one another and themselves, leading to feelings of isolation and disorientation. Technology exacerbates this condition by providing a convenient substitute for genuine human relationships and direct experience. As a result, people become comfortable with mediated communication and virtual connections, sacrificing meaningful interaction for the sake of efficiency. Ellul sees this as a kind of Faustian bargain: people trade their souls for a life of ease and convenience.\n\nWhile Ellul was writing primarily about the dangers of media and propaganda, he also warns about the dehumanizing effects of industrialized society. His vision of the future involves a world where technology has advanced to the point where people are no longer needed. As machines take over all tasks, humans become redundant and unnecessary, forced to retreat into isolated worlds of entertainment and distraction. This outcome feels eerily familiar today, as automation continues to advance and artificial intelligence becomes increasingly prevalent. Ellul's dystopian vision seems like a chilling prophecy, a warning that we should heed before it's too late.\n\nEllul\u2019s philosophy carries many implications for contemporary society, particularly in light of recent developments in technology and media. He highlights the need for critical thinking and discernment, urging readers to examine their sources of information and question the narratives they're fed. By recognizing the mechanisms of propaganda, we can begin to break free from its influence and build a healthier relationship with the media. We must also acknowledge the potential dangers of automation and the dehumanizing effects of industrialization, seeking ways to balance progress with the preservation of our humanity.\n\nIf we fail to address these issues, Ellul warns that the consequences could be dire. Under the guise of progress and convenience, we risk losing ourselves to a machine-like existence, becoming mere automatons in a world devoid of authentic connection and meaningful purpose. To prevent this outcome, Ellul encourages us to engage critically with the world around us, cultivating awareness and empathy in order to reclaim our autonomy and agency.\n\nDespite his importance as a prophetic voice, Ellul remains largely unknown outside academic circles. While some of his ideas have been influential in certain fields, his broader impact is often overlooked. Yet his warnings remain just as relevant today as they were when he first wrote them decades ago. Ellul's critique of propaganda and the dangers of technology should serve as a call to action, inspiring us to reevaluate our relationship with",
    "Jacques Ellul, the French philosopher and sociologist, was a prophetic thinker who warned us about the dangers of technology and its influence on society. In his seminal work, \"The Technological Society\" (1954), Ellul argued that modern technology is not just a tool but a system that shapes human behavior, eroding our individuality, freedom, and autonomy. His ideas were visionary, yet they remain largely overlooked by today's generation.\n\nEllul's critique of technology is two-pronged. On one hand, he argues that technology creates a totalitarian system where people are controlled by their own desires and expectations. This system induces people to conform to societal norms without even realizing it. The constant bombardment of information through advertising, media, and entertainment serves as a subtle form of psychological manipulation. People become automatons, programmed to repeat what they have been taught, unable to question or think critically.\n\nOn the other hand, Ellul contends that technology has the power to make us forget ourselves, to disconnect from our bodies and emotions. We lose touch with our natural environment and our own humanity. He likens this process to the way that water wears away stone \u2013 imperceptibly, relentlessly, until the stone becomes nothing more than a smooth surface. \n\nTechnological advancements have led us down a path of technological conformity, where we increasingly rely on machines and artificial intelligence to do everything for us. We have become so dependent on technology that we can't imagine living without it. Our minds are constantly plugged in, always connected, and never alone. Ellul would warn us that this state of perpetual connectivity has turned us into \"techno-addicts,\" numb and disconnected from the world around us.\n\nOne of Ellul's most striking critiques is that technology destroys free time. As technology takes over more and more aspects of life, we no longer have space to think deeply, reflect on our lives, or pursue creative activities. Our days are filled with obligations and duties, leaving little room for anything else. We're left with empty moments, voids that are quickly filled by technology.\n\nTechnology also robs us of our memories. In the age of digital storage, we no longer need to remember things because they're all stored safely online. Our brains atrophy, unused and unexercised. Ellul would argue that this lack of memory has devastating effects on our culture, leading to a loss of tradition, heritage, and historical context.\n\nDespite these warnings, Ellul doesn't advocate for a complete rejection of technology. Instead, he suggests that we should use technology wisely, knowing its limitations and risks. Technology can be a useful tool if we learn how to control it, rather than letting it control us.\n\nEllul's ideas are eerily relevant today. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have made us addicted to likes and shares. We've become slaves to the algorithm, conditioned to crave validation and attention. The more we click and swipe, the more we're manipulated into conforming to societal norms.\n\nWe've lost the ability to think critically, questioning the information presented to us. We've become sheep, following the herd without ever stopping to consider the truth.\n\nEllul's vision of a technologically conformist society seems too frighteningly real to ignore. In the age of social media, we're already there. It's time to wake up, to recognize the danger and take action. We must resist the pressure to conform, to challenge the status quo and reclaim our freedom. Only then can we regain control over our lives, our thoughts, and our souls.\n\nBut will we listen? Or will we continue to sleepwalk into a dystopian future? Ellul's warnings were meant to be a wake-up call, but unfortunately, many of us ignored them. Today, we're facing the consequences of our neglect.\n\nPerhaps now, though, it's not too late to hear Ellul's warning and heed it. Perhaps now we can still turn back before it's too late. But one thing is certain: we won't know unless we try.",
    "Jacques Ellul was a French philosopher, theologian, and sociologist who lived from 1912 to 1994. He is not widely known today, but he should be because his work remains relevant in the age of social media and mass surveillance.\n\nEllul's most famous book is \"Propaganda,\" which was first published in French in 1962 and later translated into English in 1965. In it, he argues that the rise of modern technology has led to the spread of propaganda and the homogenization of culture.\n\nThe word \"propaganda\" originally comes from the Latin word for \"to propagate.\" This makes sense given that propaganda involves spreading information or ideas from one person or group to another. Propaganda is often used to convince people to support a cause or adopt a belief system. However, Ellul takes issue with how propaganda shapes the very way we think and perceive reality.\n\nIn a democracy, the free flow of information is supposed to allow citizens to make informed decisions. But propaganda is designed to manipulate public opinion without giving people all the facts. It creates false dichotomies, paints opposing views as evil, and convinces us to demonize our enemies. Propaganda also relies on emotional appeals rather than reason, making us more susceptible to its influence.\n\nEllul argued that propaganda can only thrive in societies where there is a lack of critical thinking and a reliance on authority figures. This means that propaganda can easily become embedded in democratic societies. He noted that propaganda was particularly effective in totalitarian regimes like Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, but its effects are just as insidious in supposedly free countries like the United States.\n\nTo understand why propaganda is so pervasive, Ellul identified several factors that have contributed to its spread:\n\n1.  **Mass Media:** The advent of newspapers, radio, television, and film created a new environment where information could quickly reach millions of people. With these technologies, propaganda could be disseminated rapidly and efficiently.\n2.  **Technology:** The development of computers and the internet accelerated this process further by allowing for instant access to vast amounts of information. We now live in a world where misinformation can go viral in seconds.\n3.  **Social Networks:** Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are the perfect breeding ground for propaganda. Algorithms prioritize content that generates engagement, which leads to a self-reinforcing feedback loop of echo chambers and confirmation bias.\n4.  **Consumerism:** Modern society is built around consumption. People buy things they don't need, just because they're marketed to them. Advertising agencies use propaganda techniques to sell products, creating a culture of dependency on consumption. As a result, people become conditioned to accept propaganda at face value.\n5.  **Nationalism:** Nationalism creates a sense of shared identity among citizens. Propaganda uses this collective identity to manipulate people's emotions, convincing them to support wars, trade agreements, and other policies that benefit special interest groups.\n6.  **Conformity:** Conformity is essential to maintaining social order. When people conform, they accept the dominant narrative without questioning it. Propaganda exploits this desire for conformity by offering a simplified explanation for complex issues. This reduces the risk of dissent and keeps people in line.\n\nAs a sociologist, Ellul recognized that society's acceptance of propaganda reflects a deeper psychological trend. Humans have a tendency to seek answers to existential questions, such as what gives meaning to life and what lies beyond death. Since traditional religious beliefs no longer provide satisfactory answers, many turn to ideologies or superstitions. These fill the void left by spirituality and offer a simplistic explanation for the complexities of human existence.\n\nHowever, Ellul warned that this search for meaning is misplaced. Human beings will never find true fulfillment through external systems, whether they're called gods, governments, or corporations. He believed that the pursuit of happiness and purpose is ultimately futile, and that it leads to spiritual emptiness.\n\nIf humans refuse to look within themselves, Ellul argued that we'll forever be slaves to ideologies, unable to see the world objectively. Instead, we'll remain trapped in our own perceptions, accepting propaganda without question. This is precisely what happens when we let external forces shape our thoughts and actions.\n\nEllul's critique of modern society extends far beyond propaganda. He saw it as part of a broader pattern of technological conformity. Technology shapes the way we live, think, and relate to each other. For example, social media platforms control our online interactions, algorithmic feeds dictate what we consume, and smartphones monitor our movements and activities.\n\nAs a Christian, Ellul believed that humanity's relationship with God has been distorted by technology. He feared that people were losing touch with their spiritual essence, becoming mere automatons controlled by machines. If we continue down this path, Ellul warned that we may lose our individuality altogether.\n\nDespite Ellul's warnings, his message has largely gone unheeded. Today, we're more connected than ever before, yet our relationships suffer from isolation and disconnection. We're more informed than ever, yet",
    "Jacques Ellul, a French philosopher and theologian, prophesied about the dangers of mass media and technology's insidious effects on society long before our time. Yet, his work is largely forgotten today, overshadowed by other influential thinkers like Marshall McLuhan or Neil Postman.\n\nEllul's magnum opus, \"Propaganda\" (1962), was a scathing critique of how mass communication can subvert human consciousness and turn people into mindless conformists. In it, he argued that mass media has created a \"technological system\" that manipulates individuals to think in line with the interests of those who control the means of production \u2013 politicians, corporations, etc.\n\nHe warned us about the perils of totalitarianism, where people become mere automatons, conditioned to repeat slogans without questioning them. This is achieved through various techniques of persuasion, such as repetition, emotional appeal, and association with authority figures. The aim is not just to manipulate opinions but also to dull critical thinking and autonomy, making people easily controllable.\n\nIn addition to mass media, Ellul also tackled the issue of technology itself, which he saw as another source of oppression. He described the \"technological system\" as an autonomous entity that perpetuates its own growth and expansion at any cost. It creates new needs, then offers solutions to satisfy these needs, thereby increasing consumption and profit. This cycle ensnares humans, turning them into servants of technology rather than masters.\n\nTechnological advancement brings many benefits, but Ellul cautioned against the loss of individuality, freedom, and authenticity in the process. As we surrender ourselves to the machine, we become interchangeable parts in the grand machinery of modern society. We sacrifice our unique experiences, thoughts, and emotions for the sake of efficiency, productivity, and progress.\n\nNowadays, Ellul's ideas are more relevant than ever. Social media platforms have perfected the art of propaganda, conditioning users to share, like, and engage without questioning the information they consume. Algorithm-driven feeds ensure that people only see content tailored to their interests, reinforcing existing biases and silos. Critical thinking is discouraged, replaced by the instant gratification of likes and shares.\n\nMoreover, the internet has enabled the spread of disinformation, fake news, and conspiracy theories, further eroding trust in institutions and the notion of objective truth. People are manipulated into sharing baseless claims, creating echo chambers where false information becomes accepted fact.\n\nTechnology has also made it easier than ever to conform, both online and offline. The pressure to be like others is overwhelming, with social media serving as a constant reminder of what others have, do, and achieve. We compete with one another, striving to outdo each other in a never-ending quest for validation and acceptance.\n\nThe anonymity of the digital age allows us to hide behind screens, escaping accountability and responsibility. We can express ourselves freely without consequence, yet still maintain a safe distance from the real world. This dichotomy between virtual and physical reality has led to the erosion of face-to-face interactions, reducing empathy and deepening social isolation.\n\nIn the end, Ellul's vision of a totalitarian technocratic society seems disturbingly plausible. We're living in a world where technology has reduced our choices to binary options: accept the status quo or risk being ostracized, marginalized, or even persecuted.\n\nIt's high time we rediscover Ellul's prescient warnings and take action to reclaim our humanity. By understanding the mechanisms of propaganda and technological manipulation, we can resist the forces that seek to enslave us. We must question everything, including our assumptions, values, and beliefs. Only through this critical reflection can we regain our autonomy and forge a new path forward, one that prioritizes freedom, authenticity, and human dignity over convenience and conformity.",
    "In the early years of the Information Age, French philosopher and sociologist Jacques Ellul was warning us about the dangers of propaganda and its effects on human culture.\n\nEllul's classic work, \"Propaganda,\" written in 1962, is a stark reminder that the concept of propaganda goes far beyond the manipulation of information; it represents a threat to our very freedom.\n\nAs a result of propaganda, we have become \"mass men\" who are molded into one conformist shape by the media. This form of control works so well because it's done without anyone noticing. We don't even know we're being controlled anymore. Propaganda takes away our critical thinking skills. As we begin to question things, the masses react with anger. It's like they've been hypnotized.\n\nThe reason we can't see this happening is that it happens in our minds before we ever make it out into the world. Our thoughts are molded from birth until death by the society we live in. But when you're free to think for yourself, your mind opens up to new ideas and possibilities. The problem with mass man is he has no individuality left. He's just a product of the machine that created him. And if he begins to feel trapped, he'll do something terrible. He will rebel against himself. And that's what we see in mass man today - rebellion against his own self.\n\nEllul also wrote a book titled \"Technological Society.\" In this work, he argues that technology is not just an instrument that serves humanity, but rather, it is humanity that serves technology. This is what he calls \"technological neutrality.\" By allowing ourselves to be shaped by technology, we sacrifice our unique qualities and our ability to think critically.\n\nIn the age of technology, we must constantly update ourselves to keep up with changing technologies. We need to adapt our behavior to fit the latest gadgets and tools available to us. This forces us to conform to the societal norms set by technology. \n\nIt's easy to see how technology can shape our behavior. For example, if we use social media, we're influenced by its algorithms. If we watch TV, we're shaped by the programming. If we take medication, we're changed by its chemicals. All these things modify our minds. And once modified, our minds change our actions. So, what's really shaping us? Technology or our actions?\n\nWe have lost sight of who we truly are, our true nature. We're caught up in technology, our identity lost in the process. We're no longer living. We're existing.\n\nBut what about those people who refuse to submit themselves to technology? They say they're still living, still thinking for themselves. What is their secret? Is there some way they can avoid falling victim to the all-consuming force of technology? \n\nTo answer this question, we first need to understand that we're not just individuals, separate entities. We're part of a larger whole. We're all connected to each other through technology. Even when we think we're alone, we're actually part of a network.\n\nThe secret to avoiding the pitfalls of technology isn't to disconnect from it entirely. Disconnecting would only lead to isolation and loneliness. Instead, the key is to understand how technology shapes us, and then to use that knowledge to shape technology instead of letting it shape us.\n\nWe must learn to think for ourselves again. We must regain our power over technology. We must stop letting technology dictate our lives. We must start dictating its fate instead.\n\nEllul saw the potential for technology to bring us together as a global community. Yet at the same time, he warned that if we don't control technology, it could destroy us. And now, in the 21st century, it seems clear which path we're on.\n\nIn conclusion, the warnings of Jacques Ellul should not be taken lightly. His words were not meant to frighten us, but to awaken us. We're asleep, trapped in a world where technology controls our every move. It's time for us to wake up. It's time for us to rise above our animalistic nature and reclaim our humanity.\n\nAnd we mustn't just wake up; we must stay awake. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. The price of freedom is constant awareness."
