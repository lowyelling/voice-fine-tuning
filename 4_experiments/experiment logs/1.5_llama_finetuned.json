    "**Note**\n\nclass has always been this... invisible thing that I was born into. My parents are both working-class immigrants who sacrificed everything to bring me and my siblings here. They woke up every morning at 5am to make breakfast for us before they went off to their respective jobs - mom's a nurse, dad works construction. \n\nI used to watch them work so hard, exhausted but still smiling because they're chasing a dream for all of us. And then when I started school, it hit me like a ton of bricks - why did we have to struggle so much just to be here? Why couldn't we afford nice things, or go on vacations, or even eat out more than once a month?\n\nWe're lower middle class, whatever that means. We own our own home, but it's not great, and it took us years to pay off the mortgage. My parents saved up every penny they could, but it was never enough. There were times when we had to choose between paying the rent or paying for groceries.\n\nSchool made it worse. It seemed like everyone else had their whole lives together - they'd go to private schools, or live in fancy apartments, or travel during breaks. Meanwhile, my friends and I would spend hours on public transportation, sleeping on buses and trains because our parents couldn't afford cars.\n\nBut you know what they taught me in those overcrowded classrooms? That if I worked harder, if I applied myself, I could escape this life too. That if I got good grades, I could get scholarships, or a full ride to college, and then I could be one of those kids with their whole lives together.\n\nIt wasn't true, though. The myth that anyone can achieve success through hard work alone is a lie. People say \"anyone can make it to Harvard\" or \"hard work beats talent,\" but what they don't tell you is that there are systems in place that work against people like me - people of color, people with disabilities, people with non-traditional backgrounds.\n\nWhen I graduated high school, my parents finally let me take a break from school. I spent it doing nothing, literally nothing. Just sleeping in until noon, watching TV, playing video games. For the first time in my life, I didn't have to worry about what others thought of me. But as soon as summer ended, the guilt kicked back in. I felt bad for wasting my potential, for not being able to do anything productive.\n\nIt's funny, though - I'm not really sure what productivity looks like anymore. When I think about it now, I realize that my parents' work ethic isn't actually a choice, it's a survival mechanism. They're running on fumes most of the time, but they keep pushing forward because they have no other choice.\n\nAnd you know what? I don't want to be like them. Not because they're weak or lazy, but because they deserve better. They deserve rest, they deserve relaxation, they deserve to enjoy the fruits of their labor without having to stress about making ends meet.\n\nAs I look around at my community, at the exhaustion and the sacrifice, I see something different now. I see that class isn't just an economic concept, it's a system of oppression. It's a system that tells certain groups of people that they're disposable, that their lives aren't worth living unless they're contributing to the economy in some way.\n\nI don't know how to change it, exactly. I don't know how to dismantle the systems that hold us back. All I know is that I want to be honest about my experiences, about the struggles of my family and my community. I want to acknowledge that class is real, that it affects us all, and that we need to start talking about it.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for listening. If you haven't experienced poverty yourself, thank you for bearing witness. Class might be invisible, but its effects are very real.",
    "I'm a product of the public school system in the United States. I've been thinking lately about class and how it affects my life.\n\nMy parents are immigrants who came to this country for a better life. They worked multiple jobs just to make ends meet. We lived in a modest apartment in a working-class neighborhood. We were lucky if we had enough food on the table. But they instilled in me the importance of education. My mom would wake me up at 5 am every morning to study before school, so that I could have a future, so that I could get out of this cycle of poverty.\n\nBut as I got older, I started to notice the differences between us and others. The kids in my class who wore designer clothes, who went on exotic vacations, who spoke with an American accent that sounded more authentic than mine. I thought maybe that was because their families were \"wealthy\" or \"upper-class.\" But then I realized that some of them were also just like my parents - hardworking immigrants trying to make a living.\n\nThe truth is, class in America isn't just about money. It's not just about where you live or what kind of car you drive. Class is about access, opportunity, privilege. And as a first-generation immigrant, I know that my parents' sacrifices weren't just about putting food on the table - it was about giving me a chance to succeed in a society that often doesn't understand or appreciate our experiences.\n\nIt's funny - people often talk about \"the American Dream,\" but they rarely talk about the actual work that goes into achieving it. The long hours, the late nights, the early mornings. The sacrifices we make as working-class people so that our children can have a better life. The exhaustion, the stress, the pressure to perform.\n\nAnd yet, despite all these sacrifices, we're still treated like we don't belong. Like our accents are weird, our foods are exotic, our traditions are strange. Like we're perpetual foreigners in a land that's supposed to be ours too.\n\nAs I navigate adulthood, I'm learning to reconcile my identity as a Chinese-American, as a child of immigrants. I'm learning to love my hyphenated self, to find pride in my heritage, even when it feels like nobody else sees its value. And I'm learning to recognize that class isn't just about economics - it's about power, it's about privilege, it's about being seen and heard.\n\nSo yeah, I guess what I'm saying is: let's talk about class in America. Let's talk about the ways in which it affects us, the ways in which it shapes our lives. Let's acknowledge the sacrifices that we make, the struggles that we face. And let's celebrate our differences, our cultures, our stories. Because when we do, I think we'll start to see a different America - one that's more inclusive, more equitable, more just. One that recognizes that we're all in this together.",
    "Here are two possible versions:\n\n**Version 1 (Note)**\n\nClass mobility isn't just about education or hard work. It's about which neighborhoods you can afford to live in and which schools your kids can attend.\n\nMy parents are immigrants who came to this country with nothing but a suitcase full of dreams. They worked multiple jobs to scrape together enough for me to go to college. But after I graduated, my mom got sick and we had to rely on her small business to make ends meet. Now we're barely scraping by. My siblings are trying to help out, but it's tough. We moved back to my grandparents' old apartment in Flushing so that they could take care of us.\n\nI look around at my classmates, many of whom come from wealthy families with houses in the suburbs. They talk about their summer internships and family vacations like they're normal things. Meanwhile, my family is struggling just to get by.\n\nIt's not that they're smarter or more talented than us. They have resources that we don't. And sometimes I wonder if anyone would even notice if they were gone tomorrow.\n\nWe're all American now, or at least our kids are. But when it comes down to it, some of us are more American than others. And those are the ones who are supposed to succeed.\n\nBut what does it mean to be American? Is it just about being born here, or is it about something else entirely?\n\n**Version 2 (Tweet)**\n\n\"the 'American Dream' isn't about bootstrapping or'making it'. it's about having the right zip code and the right last name. i'm tired of people acting like poor people just need to 'work harder' or 'be more ambitious'. meanwhile, i've seen high schoolers from good neighborhoods score 1600s on the SAT without cracking a book. it's not about talent or drive - it's about access. who gets to be seen as 'hardworking' vs. who's just 'desperate'? \" #classmobility #firstgen #immigrantlife",
    "\"Hey everyone, it's been a minute since I last wrote on here.\n\nI've been thinking a lot lately about my experiences with class in America, especially since I started high school and now college. Growing up as a first gen Chinese American, I never really thought about class until I got to the US. My parents were refugees who left China during the '90s, and they worked multiple jobs just to get by. They never had much money, but we always had food on the table and a roof over our heads.\n\nBut when I came to America, everything changed. I saw how different people lived - their clothes, cars, houses... it was like a whole different world. And I wanted that for myself. I wanted the nice things, the fancy clothes, the car. I didn't realize at the time that those things don't necessarily make you happy.\n\nNow, as an adult, I'm starting to understand what class means in this country. It's not just about money; it's about access, privilege, and power. The people who have class are often the ones who can afford to take risks, who can afford to fail. They're the ones who can afford to be themselves without worrying about where their next meal is coming from or if they'll be able to pay rent.\n\nFor me, being first-gen and low-income meant that I had to work multiple jobs while taking classes full-time. I had to worry about paying tuition fees and textbooks and living expenses. I had to sacrifice sleep, social life, relationships... I had to give up so many things that other people took for granted.\n\nAnd it's funny, because people always talk about \"hustle culture\" and working hard. But no one ever talks about how hard it is to hustle when you're barely scraping by. When you're exhausted all the time, when you're stressed out all the time... that's not a lifestyle, that's survival.\n\nSo yeah, class is real. It's real in ways that go beyond just wealth and poverty. It's about who gets to have dignity, who gets to breathe easy, who gets to be themselves without apology.\n\nAnyway, I guess that's my two cents on class in America. What do you guys think? How do you navigate class and identity? Do you feel like you fit into any particular box?\n\nAlso, if anyone wants to discuss more, hit reply! I'd love to chat more about this.\"\n\nNote: I tried to keep the language informal and conversational, reflecting the tone of a personal Substack note or Twitter thread. The text is written in the first person, as requested, and reflects the author's personal experiences as a first-gen Chinese American growing up in a low-income household.",
    "I don't really understand how the rest of the world does it.\n\nWe got here for a \"better life.\" That means more money, more security, and most importantly, more opportunities. My parents were not lucky enough to have those things in China. They left because they wanted better for us. I've grown up with that sense of obligation to them. \n\nBut I'm beginning to see this place as just another prison. It's funny, we thought America was the land of opportunity. But what I've seen is a never-ending cycle of people running on treadmills, getting nowhere fast. We're all just trying to survive. People say the American dream is still alive. I think it's a myth. A way to keep you moving forward so you can be exploited some more.\n\nMy mom works two jobs right now, but she's barely scraping by. She says she's doing okay, but I know she's lying. I can hear the desperation in her voice when she talks about our finances. My dad has been looking for work for months, but no one wants to hire him because he doesn't speak English. And my sister, she's working hard too, but she's going through school at the same time. She\u2019s stressed out all the time. We're all running on fumes.\n\nPeople say we came to America for a better life, but what does that even mean? Do we really want to be part of this system that perpetuates itself by exploiting immigrants like us? Is this the \"American dream\" everyone talks about?\n\nI look around me and I don\u2019t see much else. This is the reality of being a poor person in America. I\u2019m tired of hearing about systemic change, tired of hearing about revolution, tired of hearing about the \u201cgreater good.\u201d Sometimes I wish people could walk in my shoes for just one day, to see how it feels to live paycheck to paycheck. To see how it feels to go to bed at night worried that you won't wake up tomorrow. \n\nThis country was built off of immigration. Immigrants built this country into what it is today. So why are we still struggling? Why are we still at the bottom rung? It seems like the only thing this country values is profit. It doesn't matter who or what it hurts along the way.\n\nI love this country sometimes, but other times I hate it. Right now, I just feel numb.\n\nThat's the reality of being an immigrant in America. \n\n---\n\nNote: The above is a fictional representation based on common experiences and perspectives within many low-income immigrant communities.

    "Here's a possible note:\n\nI was struck today thinking about Eileen Gu and Alyssa Liu. Two of us were born to our single mothers in the same region (the Bay) as adults, but we went to different high schools. We both have white dads (my dad was actually my stepdad), both had one biological mom that I knew nothing about until later in life - she was an anonymous donor. Eileen won three gold medals in freestyle skiing for China at the Beijing Olympics two years ago and has been growing her career ever since. Meanwhile, Alyssa competed for Team USA in figure skating, and after taking time off from competition, seems to be focusing on other pursuits now.\n\nWe might not be close, or even know each other, but it feels strange reading about Eileen\u2019s life because of all the things we share. I still find myself wondering what it would\u2019ve been like if I\u2019d known more about my bio mom earlier, if I could\u2019ve asked her questions, if I could\u2019ve had a relationship with her before she passed away. Eileen\u2019s always been public about hers, which I respect, even though I don\u2019t know much about hers either. I wonder how it must feel to have so many people following you online and wanting to hear your thoughts, but also how hard it can be when they put your words under a microscope too.",
    "I love hearing stories of female athletes who defy expectations! We have two incredible women who have already achieved so much in their lives, and I'm excited to see what's next for them.\n\nEileen Gu - I've been watching Eileen for years now, since she was still a teenager competing at the World Cup level. Her speed and style are mesmerizing to watch! But it's not just her athletic talent that impresses me; it's also her confidence and charisma. She's got this effortless cool factor that makes you want to be like her (or at least, I do).\n\nNow that she's won three Olympic medals, Eileen has really taken off as an influencer. And honestly, she's crushing it. She's smart, stylish, and genuine. Plus, she's not afraid to speak her mind and share her thoughts on various topics. I appreciate how she's using her platform to promote positivity and inclusivity. When she's not winning medals or creating content, Eileen is actually studying at Stanford - talk about multitasking!\n\nAlyssa Liu - I know some people might think Alyssa's story is similar to Eileen's, but they're definitely unique individuals with their own paths. Unlike Eileen, Alyssa didn't start out as a dominant force in figure skating. It wasn't until later, when she began competing regularly, that she started making waves. Despite facing setbacks along the way, including taking breaks from the sport, Alyssa persevered and eventually earned herself an Olympic medal.\n\nWhat I admire most about Alyssa is her commitment to her passion, even when things got tough. And let's talk about toughness - Alyssa's had her fair share of injuries and disappointments over the years, but she always came back stronger. Unfortunately, we don't hear much from her anymore because she's mostly gone private on social media. Still, I respect her decision to take time for herself and prioritize her well-being.\n\nBoth Eileen and Alyssa inspire me with their resilience and determination. They prove that no matter where life takes us, we all have the power to create our own paths and make something beautiful happen. What can we learn from these amazing women? That success isn\u2019t just about winning or achieving fame \u2013 it\u2019s about being true to ourselves, staying committed to our passions, and spreading kindness wherever we go.",
    "I am really fascinated by two women who I think share some interesting similarities. They both grew up in the Bay Area, were conceived via an anonymous egg donor, are mixed ethnicity (half white and half Asian), and have one parent. One woman won a gold medal in the Olympics competing for China, the other competing for the US.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about either of these ladies but it\u2019s kinda cool that they both shared so many things in common. It would be really interesting to hear their stories.",
    "Eileen Gu is often compared to me as she has taken a similar path of competitive success and an increasingly prominent presence on social media.\n\nI've always been fascinated by people who excel across multiple domains - sports, academics, entertainment. It seems like they're wired differently or have more hours in their day than I do. \n\nAs I try to be better in one area, I find it helpful to look at others in other areas. There's a lot to learn from Eileen and I'm happy to see that we share some commonality in our background stories.\n\nOn the flip side, I think it's also interesting to observe how different choices lead to vastly different experiences and outcomes. For example, Alyssa Liu didn't feel pressure to constantly post and maintain a strong online persona. Instead, she stepped away from skating, which allowed her to take care of herself without the added scrutiny. She still got to experience the thrill of winning an Olympic gold medal, but at her own pace.\n\nIt\u2019s okay if we don\u2019t all choose the same path or make the same decisions. By observing and learning from each other, we can grow in our own ways.\n\n(If you want to follow my adventures on social media, you can find me @alyssalui99)",
    "\"Just thinking about these two incredible athletes who broke barriers not just on the slopes but off them too. Eileen Gu & Alyssa Liu - they're both Bay Area born, Asian-American, & adopted by solo moms. But it's their post-olympic paths that fascinate me. Eileen is killing the influencer game while attending Stanford, flaunting her Chinese identity w/ ease (even if some call out its performative nature). On the other hand, Alyssa vanished from the public eye after her US team days ended, & you won't find much of her online presence today. Two women, same background, but different trajectories. What does this say about identity, community, & what it means to be 'Asian-American'? I'm intrigued.\""

    "Jacques Ellul (1912-1994) was a French philosopher, theologian, sociologist, and cultural critic who is widely regarded as one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century. While he may not be a household name, his work continues to influence contemporary debates on technology, media, politics, and culture.\n\nEllul's magnum opus, \"Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes,\" published in 1962, remains a seminal work on the nature of modern society. In it, he argues that modern societies are characterized by a pervasive system of propaganda, which shapes public opinion, molds attitudes, and manufactures consent. According to Ellul, this phenomenon is made possible by the rise of mass media and the increasing complexity of modern life.\n\nFor Ellul, propaganda is not simply a tool used by governments or politicians to shape public opinion; rather, it is a fundamental aspect of modern society, shaping every level of human existence. He contends that our very way of thinking and being has become shaped by a relentless barrage of messages, images, and ideas that create a kind of \"collective unconscious\" that defines our values, desires, and goals.\n\nIn this sense, Ellul can be seen as a precursor to the likes of Jean Baudrillard and other postmodern theorists who would later argue that we live in a world where simulation and hyperreality have replaced objective reality. However, Ellul's critique is more nuanced and less playful than these later thinkers. For him, propaganda is not just a reflection of a hyperreal world but a deliberate attempt to control and manipulate individuals into conforming to certain norms and values.\n\nThe key concept in Ellul's analysis of propaganda is the idea of the \"id\u00e9e-force\" - a dominant idea that becomes embedded in the collective psyche and shapes individual behavior. This id\u00e9e-force is not necessarily a coherent or rational idea but a sort of emotional and intuitive resonance that speaks directly to people's deepest fears, desires, and anxieties. Propaganda works by tapping into this id\u00e9e-force, using images, symbols, and narratives that activate and reinforce it.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Ellul's thought is his analysis of the relationship between propaganda and technology. He saw technology as both a cause and effect of the propaganda system. On the one hand, new technologies like radio, television, and advertising enable the widespread dissemination of propaganda messages. On the other hand, the very process of social change brought about by technological advancements creates a need for propaganda as a means of managing and directing individuals toward new goals and values.\n\nThis dynamic feedback loop between technology and propaganda leads Ellul to argue that modern societies are characterized by a kind of \"technological idolatry.\" We worship at the altar of progress and innovation, sacrificing our critical faculties and moral integrity on the altar of efficiency and convenience. This idolatry is not just a matter of personal choice but a systemic condition that pervades all levels of society.\n\nEllul's analysis of propaganda and technological conformity is often compared to that of Herbert Marcuse, another influential thinker of the mid-20th century. Both authors see modern society as characterized by a kind of \"one-dimensional man\" who is reduced to a state of mere consumerism and acquiescence. However, whereas Marcuse sees this condition as a result of repressive capitalist ideology, Ellul locates the source of the problem in the very fabric of modernity itself.\n\nIf we take Ellul seriously, then, what does it mean to live in a world where propaganda and technological conformity are so deeply ingrained? One response might be to retreat from the fray, opting out of the propaganda machine and seeking some form of authentic, pre-propagandized existence. But Ellul is clear that such a move is impossible. Our very language, our thoughts, and our actions are already shaped by the id\u00e9e-force, making it difficult to imagine a life outside the propaganda system.\n\nA more promising approach might be to adopt a stance of \"critical obedience.\" This involves acknowledging the pervasive nature of propaganda while also recognizing that our capacity for resistance and critique is still present, even if it's latent. Critical obedience requires us to develop a heightened awareness of the ways in which we're being manipulated and controlled, allowing us to think critically about the messages we receive and the choices we make.\n\nUltimately, Ellul's work serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the importance of maintaining a critical perspective in the face of overwhelming pressure to conform. As we navigate the complexities of our own era \u2013 marked by social media, AI, and biotechnology \u2013 Ellul's ideas remain more relevant than ever. His prophetic vision challenges us to consider the long-term consequences of our choices and to seek a more authentic, more humane path forward.",
    "Jacques Ellul, a French philosopher and sociologist, wrote several books in the mid-20th century that critiqued technology's influence on society and politics. His book \"Propaganda\" (1962), especially, critiqued how governments used mass media to shape public opinion. However, Ellul has been somewhat overlooked or marginalized by modern academia.\n\nEllul was born in 1912 in Bordeaux, France, and studied at the University of Bordeaux. He served during World War II, after which he joined the Reformed Church of France. He studied theology at the Protestant seminary in Paris, and later earned his Ph.D. from the University of Lyon. Ellul taught at the Facult\u00e9 libre de th\u00e9ologie protestante in Geneva before moving back to France, where he taught at the University of Lyon until his retirement.\n\nEllul's work often focused on the relationship between technology and culture, which he argued had led to an unprecedented level of control and manipulation over people's lives. In \"The Technological Society,\" Ellul posited that technology creates a form of \"technological idolatry.\" People tend to attribute value to objects rather than the Creator, he said. This results in their dependence on technology for happiness and fulfillment. Ellul also believed that this idolatrous nature of technology undermines democracy and the ability of people to govern themselves effectively.\n\nIn \"Propaganda\", Ellul argued that propaganda is not limited to the obvious methods of persuasion, but instead, it permeates all aspects of society, including education, art, news, advertising, entertainment, and politics. It shapes our thoughts and perceptions subtly yet effectively. As a result, we often become mindless consumers, buying into ideologies without critically evaluating them. Our worldviews are shaped by our environment, Ellul suggested, making us conform to the dominant norms of society.\n\nEllul did not propose that propaganda is a new phenomenon; he claimed it's just more powerful now because of technology's advancements. Propaganda used to be the domain of totalitarian regimes, like Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Soviet Union. However, modern democracies have developed sophisticated forms of propaganda as well. We see this in the way they promote consumerism, nationalism, and patriotism through various media channels. Furthermore, Ellul pointed out that people are often complicit in this process, actively participating in the construction of their own oppression. They unwittingly reinforce the very systems that control them, creating a false sense of freedom.\n\nSome may argue that Ellul's ideas seem outdated, particularly in the context of social media, the internet, and other digital technologies that have transformed the way information spreads. Social media platforms can amplify voices, create global communities, and facilitate information sharing. On the surface, these developments might seem to contradict Ellul's claims about propaganda. Yet, in many ways, Ellul's observations remain relevant today.\n\nFor instance, while social media does provide opportunities for dissenting voices to be heard, these platforms also serve as powerful tools for propaganda. Algorithms prioritize content based on engagement metrics, which often lead to echo chambers where people only consume information that confirms their pre-existing biases. Moreover, social media companies collect vast amounts of data on users' behaviors and preferences, using this information to tailor advertisements and messages that further reinforce those biases. These practices perpetuate the kind of subtle manipulation Ellul described in \"Propaganda.\"\n\nFurthermore, social media has enabled governments and corporations to reach wider audiences with tailored messages, exercising significant control over public discourse. A government can disseminate misinformation or propaganda through bots, troll farms, or even by paying influencers to spread certain narratives. Corporations use targeted advertising to shape consumer preferences and influence cultural values. In both cases, the lines between truth and falsehood, fact and fiction, blur, leaving individuals vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nAdditionally, social media platforms often encourage the creation and dissemination of spectacle, noise, and chaos. Users compete for attention, generating a constant stream of noise that drowns out meaningful discussion and critical thinking. This makes it difficult for people to discern what is true and what is false, leading to a sort of \"technological idiocy\" similar to Ellul's notion of \"technological idolatry.\"\n\nEllul's work serves as a warning against the dangers of unchecked technological progress. While some may dismiss his ideas as old-fashioned, his critiques of propaganda and technological conformity remain pertinent in today's digital age. His philosophy cautions us to be aware of the ways in which technology shapes our perceptions and actions, urging us to think critically and resist the subtle forces of manipulation that seek to control our minds.",
    "In the mid-20th century, amidst the turmoil of World War II and its aftermath, a French philosopher emerged to warn against the dangers of modernity's insidious forces. Jacques Ellul (1912-1994) was a theologian, sociologist, and critic of technology who prophesied about the perils of propaganda, consumerism, and the dehumanizing effects of mass society. Though his work remains largely overlooked in contemporary discussions around these topics, Ellul's warnings are eerily prescient, making him a forgotten prophet of our times.\n\nEllul's magnum opus, \"The Technological Society,\" published in 1954, is a sweeping critique of the impact of industrialization on human relationships, culture, and the very fabric of our existence. In it, he argues that technology has become an all-encompassing force that transforms the world into a vast machine, reducing human beings to mere cogs within its gears. This mechanistic worldview strips individuals of their autonomy, free will, and genuine agency, rendering them passive consumers subject to the whims of the technocratic elite. \n\nFurthermore, Ellul exposed the sinister dynamics of propaganda, which he saw as a deliberate attempt to control people's thoughts, feelings, and actions through carefully crafted messages and images. Propaganda, according to Ellul, creates a false consensus by manipulating public opinion, obscuring truth, and suppressing dissent. By eroding critical thinking and independent judgment, propaganda renders populations receptive to manipulation and easier to govern. As we now know from the rise of social media and the 24-hour news cycle, Ellul's observations remain disturbingly relevant today.\n\nOne of Ellul's most astute insights concerns the cult of consumption, which he described as the ultimate goal of advanced capitalist societies. The relentless drive for growth and profit leads to a never-ending pursuit of novelty, fuelling a culture of disposability and waste. People become defined not by what they produce or contribute but by what they consume. This paradigm reinforces social stratification, as those with access to resources are cast as superior to those without. In this framework, identity is reduced to economic status, further eroding the bonds that hold communities together.\n\nEllul also foresaw the consequences of mass society's emphasis on efficiency, speed, and standardization. He lamented the loss of craftsmanship, traditional skills, and human touch in the face of automation and assembly-line production. As we have witnessed over the past several decades, the relentless push for globalization and neoliberal policies has accelerated this process, resulting in widespread job displacement, environmental degradation, and cultural homogenization. Ellul's warnings about the dehumanizing effects of technological progress are stark reminders that growth and progress often come at a terrible cost.\n\nGiven the eerie relevance of Ellul's ideas, why do we forget prophets like him? One reason lies in the cyclical nature of history: problems that seemed catastrophic in one era may seem manageable or even desirable in another. In our current age of digital connectivity and information overload, many assume that technology inherently democratizes power, empowers marginalized voices, and fosters global understanding. While technology certainly offers unprecedented opportunities for connection and knowledge-sharing, Ellul's work reminds us that its dark side\u2014surveillance capitalism, echo chambers, and algorithmic manipulation\u2014is equally real and menacing.\n\nAs we hurtle forward into a world where AI, biotechnology, and virtual reality threaten to redefine the boundaries between human and machine, Ellul's work serves as a timely reminder that the price of progress can be steep indeed. His ideas about the need for genuine community, critical thinking, and authentic human experience should not be relegated to the dustbin of history but rather serve as a call to action for a more thoughtful, compassionate future.\n\nUltimately, Ellul's legacy lies not only in the prophetic accuracy of his diagnoses but also in his insistence on hope. He did not advocate for rejecting technology outright; instead, he called for a responsible engagement with the tools we create, tempered by wisdom, humility, and a deep respect for the complexities of human existence. We would do well to heed Ellul's warning and rediscover his work, lest we succumb to the conformist pressures of a world driven by machines, money, and empty headlines.",
    "Jacques Ellul, a French philosopher and sociologist, was born on January 5, 1912, in Dr\u00e9anu (now known as C\u0103d\u0103leni), Romania. He died on May 20, 1994, at the age of 82, leaving behind a body of work that critiques modernity's relationship with technology and its impact on human society. While not widely known today, Ellul is often regarded as a forgotten prophet who accurately predicted many aspects of our current world.\n\nEllul's most famous book, 'Propaganda,' written in 1962, explores how techniques used by those in power to shape public opinion are applied universally, even when they serve interests contradictory to the greater good. His theories regarding mass manipulation were groundbreaking for their time and continue to be relevant today. Many individuals view Ellul\u2019s ideas concerning propaganda as insightful but too radical or extreme. However, his message remains a warning against the risks associated with giving too much control to the propagandists and media moguls controlling public narratives.\n\nAs Ellul saw it, modern society has become enslaved by technology, where people live \"in servitude\" because technology serves as the driving force of history. Ellul believed that we have placed too much faith in science and technology to solve humanity's problems. This has led to the neglect of other aspects of life such as art, literature, music, and spirituality. He argued that people are increasingly disconnected from one another and from nature due to this over-reliance on technology.\n\nIn 'The Technological Society,' published in 1954, Ellul discusses the way in which technology can enslave people through automation, industrialization, and standardization. According to him, technology causes us to live a predetermined life where we are no longer free agents. People do what machines tell them to do and conform to societal norms without questioning why. Technology allows governments, corporations, and institutions to control every aspect of our lives. Our reliance on technology eliminates the need for physical labor, leading to idleness and disconnection from meaningful pursuits. As a result, humans lose touch with their passions and imagination, becoming mere automatons.\n\nOne of Ellul's key concepts is the idea of the \"techno-structure.\" The techno-structure refers to a system where technology shapes culture and vice versa. In this system, society adapts itself according to the logic of machines rather than human needs. Humans begin to think in terms of efficiency, productivity, and profit instead of freedom, happiness, and well-being.\n\nEllul also critiqued the notion of \"breadth,\" or superficial knowledge. Breadth refers to having a wide range of information at one's fingertips but lacking depth in any particular area. In today's digital age, breadth has become more accessible than ever before. We are all capable of accessing vast amounts of information instantly, thanks to the internet. However, Ellul would likely argue that while this increased access to information may seem beneficial, it results in a lack of understanding and appreciation for any single topic. This shallow knowledge keeps people ignorant and unfulfilled, rendering them easier to manipulate.\n\nAnother concept Ellul discussed is \"technique,\" which he defined as a methodical approach that uses specialized tools to accomplish a task efficiently. Technique takes precedence over other ways of doing things, resulting in uniformity and homogenization. With technique comes a loss of individuality and creativity, as people conform to established patterns of thought. \n\nTo resist the effects of the techno-structure and technique, Ellul advocated for living \"in revolt\" \u2013 a state of being that resists the mainstream and seeks meaning beyond materialism. To achieve this state, Ellul recommended disconnecting from technology and engaging in activities that promote self-awareness and personal growth. By rejecting the status quo and embracing alternative perspectives, we might break free from the chains of technology-induced enslavement.\n\nWhile Ellul's ideas might seem radical, they offer valuable insights into the perils of relying too heavily on technology. As technology continues to advance and shape our world, Ellul's warnings remind us of the importance of balance and critical thinking. They encourage us to question the systems and structures that govern our lives and seek out new paths that prioritize human flourishing over efficiency and productivity. As a forgotten prophet, Ellul's legacy deserves recognition for its relevance to contemporary issues surrounding technology and conformity.",
    "Jacques Ellul, a French philosopher and sociologist, is often regarded as one of the most astute observers of modern society in the 20th century. His prophetic works on technology, propaganda, and societal manipulation have left an indelible mark on critical thought. In this essay, we will delve into Ellul's groundbreaking ideas on the effects of technological advancement, the insidious nature of propaganda, and how these intertwined forces shape contemporary culture.\n\nBorn in Bordeaux, France in 1912, Ellul was a committed Christian who became increasingly disillusioned with the church's role in the world. This led him to question the notion of a technocratic utopia, where humanity might achieve unprecedented prosperity through science and technology. However, Ellul soon realized that this supposed ideal was instead driving us towards a dystopian future. He warned that technology was not only shaping our tools but also our thoughts, behaviors, and values.\n\nIn his seminal work \"The Technological Society,\" published in 1954, Ellul provided a searing critique of the all-encompassing influence of technology in modern life. He contended that machines were not just instruments for improving human existence but had become the defining characteristic of our era. As machines took over, humans lost control, surrendering their creative faculties and moral agency to the whims of technology. Ellul argued that this shift from manual to mechanical production eroded human craftsmanship, which he saw as essential for personal freedom and genuine creativity.\n\nEllul's observations on propaganda were equally prescient. In his book \"Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes\" (1962), he analyzed the ways in which governments, institutions, and ideologies manipulate public opinion through language, images, and media. Propaganda, according to Ellul, serves to conceal reality rather than reveal it, masking power structures behind a veil of persuasion. This form of social control enables those in positions of authority to maintain their grip on society by shaping collective attitudes and opinions.\n\nIn Ellul's view, the interplay between technology and propaganda creates a vicious cycle of conformity. As people are conditioned to accept the dominant narratives, they internalize the values and norms imposed upon them. This leads to a homogenized culture, where individuals conform to the expectations of the masses rather than forging their own paths. By acquiescing to the status quo, people abandon their capacity for independent thought and action, becoming mere automatons in the grand machine.\n\nEllul's insights into this phenomenon predate the likes of Jean Baudrillard and Guy Debord, thinkers known for their theories on postmodern simulation and spectacle. However, Ellul's warnings went largely unheeded during his lifetime. Despite being a respected scholar in his native France, his ideas never gained widespread recognition until much later.\n\nOne reason for Ellul's relative obscurity may be attributed to his unique blend of philosophical, theological, and sociological perspectives. His analysis of technology, propaganda, and societal manipulation defies easy categorization within disciplinary boundaries. Furthermore, Ellul's critiques were rooted in a conservative Christianity that put him at odds with the intellectual establishment. His views on the dangers of technology were seen as Luddite or even reactionary by some, while his skepticism toward propaganda made him appear too critical of democracy.\n\nNonetheless, Ellul's work remains a vital warning against the perils of a technocratic society. As we navigate the challenges of the digital age, his ideas offer a necessary corrective to the triumphalism surrounding technological progress. Ellul reminds us that the relentless march of innovation can lead us down a path of enslavement, eroding our humanity and individuality.\n\nIn conclusion, Jacques Ellul stands as a forgotten prophet of our times, offering a powerful critique of the insidious forces shaping contemporary culture. Through his insightful analyses of technology and propaganda, he exposed the hidden dynamics of social control and conformity. While his ideas may have been ahead of their time, they remain crucial for understanding the complex issues facing us today. As we continue to grapple with the consequences of technological advancement and mass communication, Ellul's legacy serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of critically examining the systems that govern our lives."
