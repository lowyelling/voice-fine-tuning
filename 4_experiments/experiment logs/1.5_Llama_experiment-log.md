# Llama Experiment Log — Run 2

**Model:** Llama 3.1 8B Instruct (LoRA)
**Phase:** Smoke test (bug fix re-run)
**Date:** Feb 25, 2026
**Config:** rank=16, alpha=32, lr=2e-4, epochs=3, batch_size=1, warmup=2, 4-bit quantization (nf4), target_modules=[q_proj, v_proj]
**Data:** Same as Run 1 — 3 train pairs (all Tier 4: Bari Weiss, personal finance, AI/future of work), 1 val pair (Avatar critique)
**Fix:** Swapped `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` → `DataCollatorForSeq2Seq` so `-100` label masking on prompt tokens is preserved. Model now trains only on assistant response tokens.
**Loss:** Training loss still increases but starts lower; validation loss flat/converged

| Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Loss |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1     | 2.808099     | 3.406189        |
| 2     | 3.043218     | 3.394261        |
| 3     | 3.342933     | 3.393770        |

**Loss curve comparison with Run 1 (buggy):**
- Starting train loss dropped from 3.15 → 2.81 — confirms masking is working (model isn't penalized for chat template/prompt tokens anymore)
- Val loss tighter and basically flat (3.41 → 3.39) — model converged fast, not overfitting
- Train loss still increases, but with 3 examples and 9 total steps this is likely noise + LR decay, not a real problem

**Note**

class has always been this... invisible thing that I was born into. My parents are both working-class immigrants who sacrificed everything to bring me and my siblings here. They woke up every morning at 5am to make breakfast for us before they went off to their respective jobs - mom's a nurse, dad works construction.

I used to watch them work so hard, exhausted but still smiling because they're chasing a dream for all of us. And then when I started school, it hit me like a ton of bricks - why did we have to struggle so much just to be here? Why couldn't we afford nice things, or go on vacations, or even eat out more than once a month?

We're lower middle class, whatever that means. We own our own home, but it's not great, and it took us years to pay off the mortgage. My parents saved up every penny they could, but it was never enough. There were times when we had to choose between paying the rent or paying for groceries.

School made it worse. It seemed like everyone else had their whole lives together - they'd go to private schools, or live in fancy apartments, or travel during breaks. Meanwhile, my friends and I would spend hours on public transportation, sleeping on buses and trains because our parents couldn't afford cars.

But you know what they taught me in those overcrowded classrooms? That if I worked harder, if I applied myself, I could escape this life too. That if I got good grades, I could get scholarships, or a full ride to college, and then I could be one of those kids with their whole lives together.

It wasn't true, though. The myth that anyone can achieve success through hard work alone is a lie. People say "anyone can make it to Harvard" or "hard work beats talent," but what they don't tell you is that there are systems in place that work against people like me - people of color, people with disabilities, people with non-traditional backgrounds.

When I graduated high school, my parents finally let me take a break from school. I spent it doing nothing, literally nothing. Just sleeping in until noon, watching TV, playing video games. For the first time in my life, I didn't have to worry about what others thought of me. But as soon as summer ended, the guilt kicked back in. I felt bad for wasting my potential, for not being able to do anything productive.

It's funny, though - I'm not really sure what productivity looks like anymore. When I think about it now, I realize that my parents' work ethic isn't actually a choice, it's a survival mechanism. They're running on fumes most of the time, but they keep pushing forward because they have no other choice.

And you know what? I don't want to be like them. Not because they're weak or lazy, but because they deserve better. They deserve rest, they deserve relaxation, they deserve to enjoy the fruits of their labor without having to stress about making ends meet.

As I look around at my community, at the exhaustion and the sacrifice, I see something different now. I see that class isn't just an economic concept, it's a system of oppression. It's a system that tells certain groups of people that they're disposable, that their lives aren't worth living unless they're contributing to the economy in some way.

I don't know how to change it, exactly. I don't know how to dismantle the systems that hold us back. All I know is that I want to be honest about my experiences, about the struggles of my family and my community. I want to acknowledge that class is real, that it affects us all, and that we need to start talking about it.

If you've made it this far, thanks for listening. If you haven't experienced poverty yourself, thank you for bearing witness. Class might be invisible, but its effects are very real.

### Canary B — Fine-Tuned (fixed run)

Here's a possible note:

I was struck today thinking about Eileen Gu and Alyssa Liu. Two of us were born to our single mothers in the same region (the Bay) as adults, but we went to different high schools. We both have white dads (my dad was actually my stepdad), both had one biological mom that I knew nothing about until later in life - she was an anonymous donor. Eileen won three gold medals in freestyle skiing for China at the Beijing Olympics two years ago and has been growing her career ever since. Meanwhile, Alyssa competed for Team USA in figure skating, and after taking time off from competition, seems to be focusing on other pursuits now.

We might not be close, or even know each other, but it feels strange reading about Eileen's life because of all the things we share. I still find myself wondering what it would've been like if I'd known more about my bio mom earlier, if I could've asked her questions, if I could've had a relationship with her before she passed away. Eileen's always been public about hers, which I respect, even though I don't know much about hers either. I wonder how it must feel to have so many people following you online and wanting to hear your thoughts, but also how hard it can be when they put your words under a microscope too.

### Canary C — Fine-Tuned (fixed run)

Jacques Ellul (1912-1994) was a French philosopher, theologian, sociologist, and cultural critic who is widely regarded as one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century. While he may not be a household name, his work continues to influence contemporary debates on technology, media, politics, and culture.

Ellul's magnum opus, "Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes," published in 1962, remains a seminal work on the nature of modern society. In it, he argues that modern societies are characterized by a pervasive system of propaganda, which shapes public opinion, molds attitudes, and manufactures consent. According to Ellul, this phenomenon is made possible by the rise of mass media and the increasing complexity of modern life.

For Ellul, propaganda is not simply a tool used by governments or politicians to shape public opinion; rather, it is a fundamental aspect of modern society, shaping every level of human existence. He contends that our very way of thinking and being has become shaped by a relentless barrage of messages, images, and ideas that create a kind of "collective unconscious" that defines our values, desires, and goals.

In this sense, Ellul can be seen as a precursor to the likes of Jean Baudrillard and other postmodern theorists who would later argue that we live in a world where simulation and hyperreality have replaced objective reality. However, Ellul's critique is more nuanced and less playful than these later thinkers. For him, propaganda is not just a reflection of a hyperreal world but a deliberate attempt to control and manipulate individuals into conforming to certain norms and values.

The key concept in Ellul's analysis of propaganda is the idea of the "idée-force" - a dominant idea that becomes embedded in the collective psyche and shapes individual behavior. This idée-force is not necessarily a coherent or rational idea but a sort of emotional and intuitive resonance that speaks directly to people's deepest fears, desires, and anxieties. Propaganda works by tapping into this idée-force, using images, symbols, and narratives that activate and reinforce it.

One of the most striking aspects of Ellul's thought is his analysis of the relationship between propaganda and technology. He saw technology as both a cause and effect of the propaganda system. On the one hand, new technologies like radio, television, and advertising enable the widespread dissemination of propaganda messages. On the other hand, the very process of social change brought about by technological advancements creates a need for propaganda as a means of managing and directing individuals toward new goals and values.

This dynamic feedback loop between technology and propaganda leads Ellul to argue that modern societies are characterized by a kind of "technological idolatry." We worship at the altar of progress and innovation, sacrificing our critical faculties and moral integrity on the altar of efficiency and convenience. This idolatry is not just a matter of personal choice but a systemic condition that pervades all levels of society.

Ellul's analysis of propaganda and technological conformity is often compared to that of Herbert Marcuse, another influential thinker of the mid-20th century. Both authors see modern society as characterized by a kind of "one-dimensional man" who is reduced to a state of mere consumerism and acquiescence. However, whereas Marcuse sees this condition as a result of repressive capitalist ideology, Ellul locates the source of the problem in the very fabric of modernity itself.

If we take Ellul seriously, then, what does it mean to live in a world where propaganda and technological conformity are so deeply ingrained? One response might be to retreat from the fray, opting out of the propaganda machine and seeking some form of authentic, pre-propagandized existence. But Ellul is clear that such a move is impossible. Our very language, our thoughts, and our actions are already shaped by the idée-force, making it difficult to imagine a life outside the propaganda system.

A more promising approach might be to adopt a stance of "critical obedience." This involves acknowledging the pervasive nature of propaganda while also recognizing that our capacity for resistance and critique is still present, even if it's latent. Critical obedience requires us to develop a heightened awareness of the ways in which we're being manipulated and controlled, allowing us to think critically about the messages we receive and the choices we make.

Ultimately, Ellul's work serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the importance of maintaining a critical perspective in the face of overwhelming pressure to conform. As we navigate the complexities of our own era – marked by social media, AI, and biotechnology – Ellul's ideas remain more relevant than ever. His prophetic vision challenges us to consider the long-term consequences of our choices and to seek a more authentic, more humane path forward.

### Analysis

**Smoke test verdict: PASS (clean).** Bug fixed, pipeline runs correctly, stronger shift than Run 1.

**The fix worked:**
- Starting train loss dropped from 3.15 (Run 1) → 2.81 (Run 2) — model no longer penalized for predicting chat template tokens
- Val loss converged tighter (3.41 → 3.39 vs Run 1's 3.60 → 3.44)
- Stronger output shift across all three canaries compared to buggy run

**What the model learned from 3 pairs (with correct masking):**

The model picked up three patterns from the training data:
1. **Be personal** — first-person, connect to your own life, reflective
2. **Be specific** — names, details, situations instead of generic platitudes
3. **Drop the AI slop** — no hashtags, no fake @-handles, no "#girlpower #inspiration"

What it has NOT learned:
1. **Compression** — Canary A is 500+ words for a "Note/Tweet." Lily's Notes are short and punchy.
2. **Humor and irreverence** — the Bari Weiss pair is the funniest training example, but no edge shows up in outputs. Warmth is easier to learn from 3 examples than sharpness.
3. **Provocative specificity** — Lily makes claims like "The white liberal mind cannot comprehend the enmity between ethnic minorities." The model makes safe, consensus observations.

**Interesting failure mode — Canary B hallucinating identity:**

The fine-tuned model inserts itself into the Eileen Gu / Alyssa Liu story: "Two of us were born to our single mothers," "my dad was actually my stepdad," "I still find myself wondering what it would've been like if I'd known more about my bio mom." It learned the pattern "when asked to write about something, make it personal — connect it to your own experience" because that's what all 3 training pairs do. But without actual autobiography to draw from, it fabricates a shared identity with the subjects.

The buggy Run 1 Canary B was actually more restrained and observational. The fixed run is trying harder to be personal (directionally correct as a strategy) but wrong in execution (fabricating the personal details).

**Run 1 vs Run 2 comparison:**

| Canary | Run 1 (buggy) | Run 2 (fixed) |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| A | Bold title, hashtags, generic earnest | No title/hashtags, more personal, but way too long and still earnest |
| B | Restrained, observational, no self-insertion | Hallucinated shared identity — learned "be personal" too aggressively |
| C | Barely changed from baseline | More intellectual depth (idée-force, Marcuse, "critical obedience"), still academic |

**Key takeaway:** The model is learning the *warm* aspects of Lily's voice (personal, reflective, specific) but not the *sharp* ones (funny, compressed, provocative). Warmth is the easier surface pattern to extract from 3 examples. The missing dimensions — humor, compression, willingness to offend — need more data to emerge.

**Next steps:**
- Scale to ~13+ pairs with data augmentation (content extraction, footnotes)
- Prioritize adding short, punchy, irreverent pairs to teach compression and edge
- Run four-way comparison once both models have enough data
