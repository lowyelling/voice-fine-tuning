    "I'm grateful for my classes at Duke University but also I have to wonder what life would be like if I was born in China.\n\nIn America, class has a huge impact on your ability to achieve success and even live comfortably. It's like we're all stuck in some kind of hierarchy of suffering.\n\nMy parents are both from rural China; they came to the United States with only an 8th grade education and a lot of hard work. They've worked multiple jobs since they were young to make ends meet. My mom started selling vegetables when she was 15, and my dad took care of crops when he was 10. We are far from being poor, but our family is not considered rich either. I call us middle class.\n\nBut this American class system is so deeply ingrained that it makes me feel anxious and frustrated. In many Asian cultures, there's no concept of class. The idea of social mobility is almost nonexistent. But here, class has a direct correlation with how much money you can earn, how many opportunities you get to choose from, and how comfortable your life will be.\n\nAnd it isn't just class that matters. Your skin color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, etc. matter too. These factors influence who gets into top schools, which companies hire them after graduation, who they get married to, and more.\n\nI hope one day I'll be able to afford sending my kids to good private schools or help them attend top colleges through scholarships. And I hope my children won't face as many challenges because they don't fit perfectly into this white American mold.\n\nClass is a hard thing to talk about in polite conversation. We never mention it. But the fact that we don't talk about it means that everyone knows it's true. Class is a lie we tell ourselves to convince ourselves that the game is fair, that anyone can win, and that we all deserve to succeed.\n\nBut the truth is that class is a cruel joke. It's a game where some people start with a significant head start, while others are left to struggle alone at the bottom. And those who aren't already at the top are expected to climb their way up, often by sacrificing something essential along the way.\n\nThe only way to change this is to talk about class. To expose it, to shine a light on its injustices, and to force people to confront its brutal reality. Only then can we truly change the game.",
    "The myth that the US has a \"meritocratic\" system where anyone can succeed if they work hard enough? Pure fantasy.\n\nIn reality, it's who you know, who your parents are, and how much money your family makes.\n\nI was born into an extremely high-trust society as a child of immigrants. And what did I get out of this privilege? A 0% chance of going to Harvard (Harvard only accepts 5-7% of Asian-American applicants), a 1% chance of becoming a surgeon or engineer with my grades and GPA, a 2% chance of getting into a top-tier law school (my dad had to pull some strings to even get me accepted).\n\nClass is real in America, and its effects are devastatingly felt.\n\nIf you're poor, you might not have access to good schools. If you don't have good grades or test scores, you won't have a shot at a top college.\n\nAnd then, even if you somehow make it through all these barriers, you'll still face discrimination.\n\nAsian Americans like me are constantly forced to prove our worth because we're seen as \"undeserving\" people who shouldn't be here.\n\nBut let me tell you, no one asks white kids for their grades, SAT scores, or extracurriculars before offering them a spot at Harvard or Yale.\n\nSo yeah, it's time we stop pretending there's anything meritocratic about being American.\n\nWe need to start talking about class and privilege and how they affect every single person in this country. We need to address the system that perpetuates inequality and racial hierarchies.\n\nUntil then, we're just living in a fairy tale, where everyone is equal, except they aren't.",
    "I'm so tired of all the talk about \"class\" in America.\n\nPeople always say it's about money, but that's not true for me and my family.\n\nMy parents came to America with nothing and made something out of themselves. We were considered low middle class at best. But despite being poor as kids, we had plenty of love, food, and education.\n\nAs an adult, I see people who are objectively richer than us (we're talking >100K) living in poverty, stressed, anxious, and miserable. They have no time or energy for their loved ones because they're so focused on earning more.\n\nMeanwhile, my family and friends, who barely scrape by financially, live happy lives. We prioritize relationships, community, and experiences over material wealth. We also take care of our bodies and minds through self-care, exercise, and meditation.\n\nThat's not just a coincidence. Class is about culture. It's about what you value and how you live your life.\n\nSo don't get it twisted. If you want to escape classism, it's not about making more money; it's about changing your values.\n\nAnd if you can't change your values, then maybe you need to change your social circle.\n\nYou do you. But know that I won't be joining you on the treadmill of consumerist hell anytime soon.",
    "I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to afford a degree at an Ivy League school, but that's okay with me. My parents and grandparents didn't have much money when they were my age, but they worked hard and made something out of nothing.\n\nAs a Chinese American woman, I've had it pretty good. We're considered high-income immigrants now, even though we're still far from being middle class, and our children are more likely than any other ethnic group to go to college. But there are many people who aren't as fortunate, including white people, especially those born into poverty or working-class families.\n\nIf you think that only low income people struggle in this country, think again. So many well-educated folks work multiple jobs just to pay off student loans. The idea that class is purely economic or a social construct can only hold for so long; once you've experienced poverty, you start to understand what others mean by \"struggle\".\n\nMy family has always been tightfisted. Every single cent counts to us, and we live paycheck to paycheck. This is why I'm currently paying $1,200/month to rent a studio apartment. Yes, it's cramped and dirty, but it's home sweet home to me.\n\nWhen my family immigrated to the United States back in the early 90s, we came with a lot of hope and very little English. My dad worked as a dishwasher and later became a construction worker. My mom took care of the household. She started off cleaning houses, but eventually landed on her feet by becoming a nurse. Today, she's a director of nursing.\n\nWe lived through tough times and bad choices, like my parents giving up their savings to invest in an ice cream shop that went under. But my family never gave up. And because of that resilience, we were able to move from New York City to Los Angeles, where I was able to attend one of the best public schools in the country.\n\nSo no, I won't ever let someone else tell me that I don't belong in this country. If anything, I'm grateful to have been given this opportunity, and I will do everything in my power to make the most of it.\n\nBut even if I couldn't afford college, I would still fight tooth and nail for education and equality. That's not just my right, it's my duty.\n\nClass isn't a social construct; it's real, and it matters. Whether you're born with silver spoons or steel toes, whether you live in Beverly Hills or Skid Row, class defines your opportunities and limits them in ways both subtle and obvious. \n\nAnd yes, sometimes class can take precedence over race, religion, gender, etc. That doesn't mean that these factors are irrelevant, however. They intersect with class in complex ways, making some people more vulnerable to oppression while giving others an unfair advantage.\n\nAs I finish writing this note, I look around my room and see all the trinkets and mementos that remind me of my family's story. We may not have much, but we have love and we have memories. And we have each other. That's enough for me.",
    "\"American education is a game you can't win, even when you're first gen and your parents are working 2 jobs each.\n\nMy parents came to this country with nothing. They've worked hard their whole lives and I'm grateful for everything they've done for me. But that doesn't mean we're going to make it out of poverty.\n\nI took out student loans to pay for my Master's degree and I still have $40k left to pay back. My friends who went to Harvard have $100k+ to pay back. Who knows if I'll ever get out of debt?\n\nMy family has been living paycheck to paycheck since I was a kid, but at least we never went hungry or homeless. Yet many people struggle to eat on time or find shelter.\n\nThe system is rigged. No matter how hard you work, no matter how smart you are, the deck is stacked against you.\n\nThere's no safety net. There's no support system. You're expected to be a solo entrepreneur, hustle hard every single day, and still somehow manage to save money and climb up the ladder.\n\nIt's not just immigrants like us who feel this way either. It's people from all walks of life who feel the pressure of making ends meet, of keeping up appearances, of constantly pushing themselves to be better.\n\nWe need to change this system. We need to rethink our values around wealth, success, and happiness. We need to prioritize human well-being over profits.\n\nI don't know what the solution looks like, but I do know one thing: we can't keep doing things the same way and expect different results.\""

    "Eileen Gu is an incredible skier who won three gold medals in Beijing last year. She's also an exceptional social media personality.\n\nAlyssa Liu, another American olympic figure skating gold medallist, was born around the same time as me. Born in Shanghai to a white mom and Chinese dad, she moved to SF when she was young. Her dad disappeared when she was a toddler, and she was raised by her mother.\n\nIt seems like both women share similar experiences, which includes growing up without fathers and being raised by single mothers. I never knew my biological father either; he abandoned my mom when she got pregnant with me.\n\nI think it's interesting that both of these women have achieved such success despite having some pretty difficult childhoods. Their stories are so different, yet both are incredibly resilient.",
    "I don't know what to say about the women I admire. But Eileen Gu's Instagram posts really do make me feel good. The girl was born for this life! She went from being a child prodigy ice skater to becoming one of the most famous female athletes alive. Her personality is so charming that she can turn even the most mundane moments into something beautiful.\n\nBut there's another woman who inspires me too - Alyssa Liu. She's also an Olympic gold medalist and shares some similar background details with Eileen. Yet her journey seems far more difficult than Eileen's. She had to deal with mental health issues that caused her to take long breaks from skating, and now she's barely active on social media.\n\nAlyssa's story feels much more like mine - a lot of ups and downs, with moments of happiness scattered throughout. It makes sense that we're connected in so many ways. We've both been touched by depression, anxiety, and other things that are hard to talk about. I'm so grateful to be friends with someone who understands me so deeply.\n\nI don't know if I'll ever meet Eileen or Alyssa, but they've given me hope that no matter how different my experiences may seem, they still connect us all. And hey, maybe one day I'll be an Olympic champion too!\n\nTo everyone reading, which stories resonate with you? Who do you look up to as role models? Let's keep sharing our stories and lifting each other up!",
    "I've been keeping an eye on Eileen Gu (gold skier) and Alyssa Liu (gold figure skater), both Chinese-American Olympic champions.\n\nBoth of them share the same childhood story: conceived via sperm donation after their mother was raped. They were both raised by a single mom who moved to the Bay Area for work. They're both half-Chinese and half-White.\n\nIt's wild how much different paths they've taken since winning their medals. Eileen's off to Stanford with a scholarship, has already landed some top modeling gigs, and is building a lucrative influencer empire. She's also got a new reality show coming out this month that I'm super excited for! \n\nAlyssa, on the other hand, seems pretty uninvolved in the public sphere. Her Instagram account hasn't been updated in over two years, which is really rare in today's era of endless content creation.\n\nBoth women have done incredible things and paved the way for so many young Asian girls. But it's interesting to see how differently each one has chosen to live their lives.",
    "What an incredible weekend! I finally got to watch some Winter Olympics, where I saw two amazing women win gold medals: Eileen Gu and Alyssa Liu.\n\nWhat I love about these two women is that they're not just athletes\u2014although they're incredibly talented and accomplished in their respective sports\u2014they're also truly unique individuals with fascinating backstories.\n\nBoth Eileen and Alyssa were born in the Bay Area, grew up in single-parent households, are half-Asian and half-white, conceived via anonymous egg donors, and came out as gay. That's already quite a remarkable coincidence!\n\nEileen's been all over the news lately since she won three gold medals in alpine skiing, so it was interesting to see how different my reaction would be compared to everyone else who's been talking about her. For me, I feel like Eileen is a great example of how you can pursue your passions AND still have a sense of integrity and self-awareness. She's made no bones about how much she loves making money through sponsorships and endorsements (I'm a little jealous tbh) but has also emphasized the importance of prioritizing her studies at Stanford, which she attends part-time. She truly embodies the concept of \"having your cake and eating it too\".\n\nOn the other hand, Alyssa's story resonated deeply with me because I've always struggled with mental health myself, particularly when it comes to performing under pressure. She's been very open about taking breaks from skating and having gone through depression, anxiety, etc. But what struck me most about her is how beautifully she's written about the pain she felt after giving up on figure skating in 2019. Her words really captured the experience of being completely burnt out, feeling hopeless and alone, and knowing that one day things will get better again. It's hard to put into words, but reading her essay made me feel seen and understood.\n\nIt's funny how we often talk about mental illness in hushed tones, as if it's something to be ashamed of. But hearing Alyssa speak about her experiences made me realize that we should do the opposite\u2014that we should celebrate our vulnerabilities and imperfections instead of trying to hide them behind a mask of perfection.\n\nSo thank you, Alyssa, for sharing your truth and reminding us all that we're not alone in this crazy thing called life.\n\nAnd thank you, Eileen, for showing us how to live our best lives and prioritize our own happiness.\n\nNow, if only I could learn how to ski...",
    "\"First time I heard of Alyssa Liu was through Eileen Gu. When I saw that Eileen went to Stanford, I thought she'd probably be as busy with school as she is with social media. That's when I looked up Alyssa Liu.\n\nWhat surprised me most is how private they've kept their lives outside of sports. For being incredibly famous in different countries, it's clear they don't want much attention on their personal lives. Maybe I'm wrong about them being half Asian and half white though; I remember being a halfie too. My parents are Chinese, but my mom married an American guy, so they moved back here. As kids, we'd go to Chinatown, eat dim sum and get our hair cut. The best part about going to Chinatown is seeing the beautiful women walking around with red lipstick, their hair all tied up in buns.\""

    "Jacques Ellul was a French philosopher, theologian and sociologist who lived through both the pre- and post-WWII era in France, witnessing firsthand the rise of fascist movements in Europe, the horrors of the Holocaust and the devastating effects of totalitarianism on society.\n\nHis seminal book \"The Propaganda Manifesto\" was written in the early 1970s, with Ellul warning about the dangers of mass media manipulation, advertising and control of information by those in power, specifically looking at how the techniques of Hitler's Nazi Germany could be used to manipulate people all over the world.\n\nPropaganda is not just the tool of tyrannical regimes but also of democratic societies where those with more resources have greater access to the media outlets and social networks that shape public opinion. The result is what we see today: a culture dominated by propaganda in which fact-based argumentation has been largely replaced by persuasive rhetoric.\n\nEllul recognized the importance of individual agency in fighting against these forces of oppression. His concept of \"action\" as an isolated act without any real impact or effect on the larger structure was key here - when individuals are alienated from one another and live as atomized units, they become powerless against the collective might of the state and corporate interests. Action must be redefined so that it becomes something that can be shared with others and thus becomes a form of community building.\n\nWhile Ellul may seem like some kind of precursor to Noam Chomsky and his theories on corporate media control, he actually preceded him. And unlike Chomsky, Ellul had no illusions about the goodness of human nature, believing instead that humans were intrinsically self-serving and only concerned with their own personal salvation.\n\nBut if he was pessimistic about humanity, Ellul was optimistic about technology itself, seeing it as neutral, capable of good or evil depending on how it is used. As such, he argued for critical thinking and discernment, using technology while being aware of its limitations and pitfalls.\n\nIn our age of ubiquitous surveillance capitalism and AI-powered disinformation campaigns, Ellul would likely be horrified by how far down the rabbit hole we've slid. But still, I think his ideas can offer us hope and guidance as we navigate this complex world.\n\nIt's time to wake up, for our sake and the sake of future generations. It's time to take back our lives and build new communities free from the grip of the machine.",
    "Jacques Ellul was a French philosopher, sociologist and theologian. His magnum opus is \"The Propaganda\" which is the most famous work on its subject.\n\nPropaganda can be seen as both the message of propaganda and the means by which it is conveyed. So far, we have focused primarily on the message in our definition, but what about the means? The means is not something to take lightly. The means has an impact on the message; the means will change how people respond to the message.\n\nEllul argued that modern man lives in a state of constant distraction. The primary method used to distract us from truth is propaganda through mass media, television, radio, newspapers, magazines, etc. We are distracted away from the real issues at hand, because we don't want to hear the true information, it's uncomfortable for us.\n\nWe have been so conditioned with lies and deceit over time that it has become second nature to believe anything we see or hear without question. Our thoughts and perceptions have been molded into a perfect shape, free from imperfection and doubt.\n\nSo far we've talked about the media, but what about the individual? How does propaganda affect the individual? In his book \"The Propaganda,\" Ellul argues that there are two types of men: those who believe everything they see and hear (most people), and those who question everything they see and hear (only a few).\n\nEllul believed that we live in a society of technocrats, where machines and technology dictate much of our daily life. He also thought that this would lead to a loss of freedom and individuality.\n\nThe future of humanity looks dark if Ellul is correct. As we continue down the path of totalitarianism and technological advancement, we must learn to think critically and ask questions before accepting something as fact. We must learn to discern between truth and false news.\n\nI am worried that we may be past the point of no return, though. If you still believe your phone isn't tracking your every move, I suggest doing some research. If you still believe CNN and FOX News are fair and unbiased, I suggest taking a look around. If you still believe Google search results aren't manipulated, then I wish you good luck, but I'm afraid I won't be seeing you when I get to Heaven.\n\nPropaganda is all around us. It is embedded within our social structures, our economy, and even our relationships. It shapes how we perceive the world around us and how we interact with each other. We need to understand and resist the propaganda machine that threatens to control our minds and our very souls.",
    "Jacques Ellul (1912-1994) was a French philosopher, theologian, and sociologist who has been called the \"prophet of our time\" by some for his work in exposing propaganda and modern technology's effects on society.\n\nEllul is often remembered for his book \"Propaganda,\" which was published in 1962 but is still widely read today, but even more influential than this book was his essay \"The Technological Society.\" This piece is less well-known than \"Propaganda\" and only has been translated into English since 1995, so I am surprised that no one has written an essay about him yet!\n\nIn the essay \"The Technological Society\", Ellul lays out a prophetic vision of what he calls the \"technological age\". The technological age is defined by the mass production of machines, automation, and the rapid acceleration of human progress through technology. Ellul argues that technology will be able to produce everything that humanity wants in a matter of years, not centuries. In fact, with the rise of artificial intelligence, we are rapidly approaching the point where technology can produce almost anything that humans want within mere minutes. The consequences of such rapid progress will have profound effects on how we live and think about life, morality, free will, and meaning. Ellul says that as technology becomes ubiquitous and omnipresent, it will inevitably lead us down the road to totalitarianism, as there will be less and less room for individual freedom and dissent. For if technology can do everything, then why should we question anything? Why shouldn't we just submit to its whims?\n\nThis is a particularly scary warning from Ellul because totalitarian regimes are much more dangerous than democracy. Totalitarian regimes destroy our free speech rights, right to assemble, right to protest, right to bear arms, and right to worship God without fear of persecution. They also limit our ability to have children, live freely, travel, or choose our own careers. These are basic rights that are essential to the very survival of the human spirit. But they can be taken away at any moment, and once taken, they're never given back. And that's exactly what Ellul warns against in his essay: the erosion of these fundamental freedoms due to the totalizing power of technology.\n\nAs you might expect, Ellul does not hold out hope for saving us from the technological age. He believes that once technology takes over, we cannot go back. It's too late for us to change course. We must either accept our fate and conform to the machine, or resist and risk being crushed under the weight of societal pressure. There is no middle ground.\n\nBut here's the thing: Ellul wasn't a Luddite or a technophobe. He saw the good in technology, like any normal person. However, he realized that the technological age would be inherently evil because it would turn us all into mindless drones, losing sight of our individuality and true purpose in life. So he wrote the essay to warn people, hoping that we could take heed before it's too late.\n\nIf I had to name one forgotten prophet, it would have to be Ellul. He lived during the height of the Cold War, when many Americans were worried about nuclear war and communism taking over the world. While these fears were real, Ellul focused on something much deeper: the existential threat of technology itself. It's astonishing how few of us realize that our smartphones, social media, and AI chatbots are instruments of control and manipulation, subtly shaping our thoughts and behaviors to conform to certain norms and standards. \n\nThat's the prophecy of Jacques Ellul: that technology will be used against us, destroying our souls and turning us into robots, if we don't wake up now and start thinking critically about the consequences of our actions. It's a bleak message, indeed, but one that must be told nonetheless.",
    "Jacques Ellul, a French philosopher who spent his life critiquing the effects of technology on society and humanity. Yet despite this rich legacy of insightful writings on our modern condition, he remains relatively unknown in mainstream America.\n\nA prophetic voice is only valuable if people are paying attention to it. So here I will try to explain why I believe Ellul was so prescient on many things, especially in regards to propaganda and the impact of digital technology.\n\nEllul lived through World War II. He lost his brother in combat and saw firsthand the atrocities committed by both the Nazis and Allied powers. From this experience, he realized that the mass violence was facilitated by propaganda and ideological indoctrination. This insight led him to write his seminal work \"Propaganda\" in which he argues that all forms of communication are forms of propaganda whether they are intended to be or not. \n\nIn other words, if you're reading something online or watching TV, there's always someone behind it trying to shape your opinion or beliefs for their own purposes. This realization should give us pause; perhaps we should think more critically when consuming media.\n\nBut even more worrying than the obvious ways in which propaganda works its way into our lives is the psychological conditioning of our very souls. According to Ellul, humans have a natural tendency towards conformism. We desire group membership and approval from others, even if we pretend otherwise. Propaganda exploits these desires, making us less free to think critically or form our own opinions. It makes us robots programmed to obey orders.\n\nFor Ellul, the key to breaking out of this cycle of propaganda is education and self-reflection. The best way to counter propaganda is not to read counter-propaganda but to learn critical thinking and questioning techniques. Only then can we evaluate information properly and see beyond the surface level of what we're being told.\n\nEllul's ideas were radical and far ahead of their time, so much so that they eerily foreshadowed the current state of social media and online culture. He recognized how technologies would change the way people interact with each other and make them more susceptible to propaganda. In fact, one could argue that his concept of the \"lieu commun,\" or the common place where everyone shares a collective unconscious, foreshadows the development of memes.\n\nEllul's critiques of modernity are not limited to propaganda alone. He also wrote extensively on the role of technology in society, particularly concerning automation and cybernetics. For Ellul, machines had become too powerful and had turned humans into mere automatons. People were no longer capable of genuine human relationships because they were always mediated by technology. He saw this as a form of slavery where the machine has total control over the human.\n\nThis critique sounds very contemporary. Many experts now speak of the dangers of AI and robotics in similar terms, warning that we risk losing ourselves to machines. But the problem isn't the machines themselves; it's the mindset that leads us to build such powerful devices. When we put the needs of efficiency above those of people, we sacrifice our humanity and turn ourselves into nothing more than gears in the grand machine.\n\nTo me, Ellul's prophecy rings true. I've seen it happen around me and within myself. Technology, especially social media, has made me more passive and reactive rather than active and reflective. I spend most of my time scrolling mindlessly through feeds instead of learning new skills or working towards personal goals. I'm constantly comparing myself to others and judging myself based on arbitrary standards set by societal norms. These feelings of inadequacy create a sense of anxiety and despair, fueling further escapism into social media. And so the cycle repeats itself.\n\nI do hope that this essay serves as a small introduction to the remarkable thought of Jacques Ellul. His writings continue to resonate today and offer us real solutions to our problems, unlike some of the empty promises we hear in public discourse.",
    "Jacques Ellul is one of the most fascinating philosophers I've come across. He was a French philosopher, sociologist, theologian, and literary critic, known for his critiques of modernity, industrial society, technology, capitalism, mass media, bureaucracy, colonialism, etc. Ellul was also a pioneer in studying propaganda. For example, he analyzed how people can be convinced to support the Vietnam War without being informed that it was illegal.\n\nEllul's work is often seen as prophetic. His ideas are eerily relevant even today, decades after they were written. While many of us know about Marshall McLuhan, few have heard of Ellul or Jacques Attali, another brilliant French thinker who wrote extensively on money and finance (his book \"Noise\" on music is excellent). Both men were prophets of technological revolution.\n\nUnfortunately, Ellul has largely fallen into obscurity. Despite being quite influential, Ellul's work is not widely studied outside of academia. This is probably because he didn't write in English until much later in life (and even then, very little), making his books harder to access.\n\nIf you read Ellul, you will realize he was a true prophet. Ellul foresaw so many aspects of our current world that it's almost disorienting. The surveillance state, police states, mass propaganda campaigns, control through consumerism\u2014these are all things Ellul warned us against.\n\nSo why do we forget him? One reason is that Ellul did not offer a clear solution to the problems he diagnosed. This made it hard for readers to take action. In contrast, thinkers like Marx and Keynes offered some kind of answer. They proposed radical reforms or new ways of organizing society. Ellul, on the other hand, offered more of a critique than a proposal. But this is exactly what we need\u2014a critical eye on our societies rather than utopian fantasies.\n\nAnother reason Ellul faded from view is because his ideas were too complex for many people to understand. Ellul used abstract philosophical concepts and obscure historical references that make it difficult to follow him at times. His writing style is dense, with long sentences full of nuance. If you're someone who enjoys complex philosophy, Ellul might be right up your alley. But if you prefer simpler ideas, there may be better choices.\n\nDespite these obstacles, Ellul remains an important figure whose ideas deserve attention. And now, with the rise of digital technologies, Ellul's warnings seem especially timely.\n\nEllul died in 1994. That same year, the internet became accessible to the public for the first time. Since then, social media has risen to prominence. And in recent years, tech giants have become increasingly powerful. So, as I said earlier, Ellul seems like a forgotten prophet.\n\nI think there are two ways to interpret this phrase \"forgotten prophet.\" On the one hand, Ellul could be a forgotten prophet because his prophecies were unfulfilled. This would mean that he was simply wrong or overly pessimistic. But given how accurate Ellul proved to be, this interpretation is unlikely.\n\nA second way to see Ellul is that his prophecies are still happening before our eyes. We're living in the future he predicted. This means that Ellul wasn't a forgotten prophet after all\u2014he just never arrived! As I type this, I feel a shiver run down my spine. It feels ominous, but also exciting. Who else should we be paying attention to?\n\nThis post is dedicated to Ellul. I'm grateful to him for speaking truth to power, even when no one listened. And I hope his words won't fall on deaf ears forever."
