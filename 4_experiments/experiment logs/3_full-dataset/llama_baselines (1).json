    "**Substack Note**\n\n\"Growing up as a Chinese-American, I've often felt like an outsider looking in on this country's education system. My parents worked multiple jobs to give my siblings and me every opportunity they never had. But despite our hard work, we struggled to make ends meet - food stamps were a regular occurrence, and summer vacations were spent at the local library instead of expensive camps.\n\nAs a first-gen student, I was taught to prioritize education above all else. But the truth is, it wasn't until I hit college that I realized how much systemic inequality has shaped my experience. In high school, I saw classmates who were just as bright and driven as me, but their families could afford tutors, private schools, and after-school programs that made all the difference.\n\nNow, I'm not here to bash American exceptionalism or lament 'opportunity'. But I am here to say that access to quality education isn't just about individual merit or motivation. It's about recognizing that privilege and poverty have a way of tipping the scales.\n\nWe talk about the American Dream as if it's within reach for anyone willing to work hard enough. But what about those of us who are already running uphill? What about the ones who are shouldering more than one burden?\n\nAs a product of this system, I want to acknowledge the sacrifices my family made for me. And I want to shout out to all the students out there who are fighting against the odds - your stories matter. Your struggles matter. You deserve better.\"",
    "Here are two options:\n\n**Option 1 (Substack note):**\n\n---\n\nA reflection on the American Dream\n\nI still remember the day my parents brought me to this country with dreams of a better life. We were one of many \"model minority\" families who came here seeking opportunities that would be impossible for us back home. But as I navigate the complexities of American society, I'm starting to realize that the idea of the \"American Dream\" is often reserved for those who already have privilege.\n\nGrowing up, I struggled to balance cultural identity with assimilation. My parents worked tirelessly to provide for our family, but we had to scrape by just to make ends meet. The financial stress weighed heavily on all of us. And yet, despite our hard work and determination, I often felt like an outsider looking in - caught between two worlds that didn't quite fit me.\n\nIt's not until now, when I'm older and more aware, that I see how systemic inequalities shape the opportunities available to people like me. From education to economic mobility, every door seems to have its own set of barriers. It's easy to feel grateful for what I've achieved, but it's also disheartening to know that so many others face similar struggles.\n\nAs someone who's experienced firsthand the weight of being a \"model minority,\" I want to challenge the notion that success is solely dependent on individual merit. Instead, let's talk about the systems that perpetuate inequality and deny access to resources that could truly level the playing field.\n\nI hope to use this space to explore these issues and spark meaningful conversations about what it means to be an American, especially for those of us who don't fit neatly into traditional narratives.\n\n---\n\n**Option 2 (Tweet thread)**\n\n1/5 As a first-gen immigrant, I'm constantly grappling with what it means to be an American. Growing up, I thought the \"American Dream\" was within reach, but reality has been a harsh teacher. The pressure to succeed while navigating two cultures took a toll on my family & me.\n\n2/5 People often assume that immigrants come to America for opportunity, but what they don't see is the struggle to access basic needs like healthcare, education, or even clean air and water. It's not about personal responsibility; it's about systemic inequalities that keep people down.\n\n3/5 My family made sacrifices to give me a chance at a better life, but their labor was unseen & undervalued. They're part of the invisible workforce that keeps America running, yet we remain invisible to policymakers. What does it mean to be an American if we can't see ourselves?\n\n4/5 I'm tired of the myth that anyone can achieve anything through hard work alone. That narrative erases the countless barriers that stand between us & success. Let's start talking about the ways in which institutions & policies create unequal playing fields.\n\n5/5 So, what does it mean to be an American? Is it about waving a flag or following rules? Or is it about confronting the truth about who gets left behind? I want to explore these questions in this space and challenge you to join me in creating a more honest conversation about what it means to be American.",
    "**\"The struggle is real, and so are the expectations\"\n\nI was cleaning my mom's restaurant last night, just like I do every weekend. My parents came to this country with nothing but a dream, working multiple jobs to provide for our family. We're one of those \"model minorities\" people always talk about - hardworking, driven, and eager to succeed.\n\nBut as I watched my friends graduate high school, go off to college, and start their careers, it hit me: they didn't have to deal with the weight of expectation that comes with being an Asian-American. Their parents could afford tutors, private schools, and summer camps without breaking a sweat. They had the luxury of making choices, not just because they wanted to, but because they could afford to.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm expected to excel in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, math), even though I don't know if it's what I want to do. My parents expect me to make them proud, to bring home the money and prove we made the right decision moving here. But what about my own dreams? What about my happiness?\n\nIt's not just about me; it's about all the kids who come from low-income families, who work multiple part-time jobs to support their families, who juggle language barriers and cultural differences on top of academics. We deserve to chase our passions, to explore our interests, to make mistakes and learn from them without the pressure of living up to someone else's expectations.\n\nSo let's stop romanticizing the American Dream and acknowledging its harsh realities. Let's talk about the struggles of low-income families, the burden of expectation, and the complexities of identity. It's time to break free from the myth that success is solely dependent on individual merit and hard work.\n\nLet's create space for open conversations about systemic inequalities, the privilege that comes with being born into a certain socioeconomic status, and the importance of access to resources for all students. Only then can we truly understand the meaning of 'equal opportunity' and build a better future for everyone.\"",
    "**My Take on Class in America**\n\nAs I reflect on my journey as a first-generation Chinese American, I'm struck by the complexities of class in our society. Growing up in a lower-middle-class household, I've experienced firsthand the struggles and sacrifices that come with chasing the \"American Dream.\"\n\nFrom my parents' early morning shifts at their restaurant to my own late-night study sessions, we've worked tirelessly to get ahead. My mom's constant reminders to \"study hard\" and \"work harder\" became ingrained in me - but it wasn't until college that I realized why.\n\nThe harsh truth: class is not just about money; it's about opportunity, access, and privilege. As an immigrant, I had to navigate a system where the rules were unfamiliar, and the language was foreign. My parents, though well-intentioned, didn't know how to guide me through this uncharted territory.\n\nNow, as I look around at my friends and peers, I see the same fears, doubts, and anxieties playing out. The pressure to succeed, the weight of expectation, the fear of falling behind - these are the invisible forces that shape our experiences.\n\nBut what if we could redefine success? What if we prioritized community over competition? What if we acknowledged that everyone's path to prosperity looks different?\n\nAs I continue on my own journey, I want to challenge myself (and you) to rethink our understanding of class in America. Let's talk about more than just economic mobility - let's discuss the systems that perpetuate inequality. Let's amplify the voices of those who've been silenced, and lift up the stories that have been erased.\n\nIt's time for a new conversation about class in America - one that centers humanity over hierarchy.\n\nWhat do you think? Share your thoughts below!",
    "**Note**\n\nI've often felt like an outsider in my American high school, watching other students effortlessly navigate the social hierarchy and cliques. As a Chinese immigrant, I'm constantly caught between two worlds - the one my parents came from and the one I'm trying to build here.\n\nMy parents work tirelessly to provide for us, but our struggles are invisible to those who don't see the long hours they put in to make ends meet. They're not just struggling financially; they're also fighting to hold onto their cultural identity in a country that sometimes makes it hard to be proud of where we come from.\n\nPeople assume I must be some kind of genius because of my grades or that my parents' sacrifices automatically mean I'll succeed. But the truth is, my family's socioeconomic status doesn't guarantee success. We've made do with what little we have, working multiple jobs to send me to college.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means I'm stuck between being grateful for the opportunities afforded to me and resentful towards a system that doesn't acknowledge the immense effort it takes to get ahead. The same system that labels us \"underprivileged\" but expects us to thrive despite the obstacles.\n\nThis tension is exhausting, and I know I'm not alone. There are countless others who struggle to reconcile their identities, their cultures, and their aspirations. Let's stop romanticizing the \"American Dream.\" Instead, let's talk about the hard realities faced by immigrants like me.\n\nWe're not just statistics or symbols of hope; we're complex individuals navigating a country that's still figuring out its place within itself. And until we confront these harsh truths, no amount of \"pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps\" can erase the systemic barriers that stand in our way.\n\n---\n\nOr\n\nTweet:\n\n\"We're not 'underdogs.' We're not 'overnight successes.' We're immigrants who toil in obscurity, our stories invisible to those who don't see the sweat, the tears, and the sleepless nights. Stop romanticizing the American Dream. Talk about the systemic barriers that silence us.\" #immigrantlife #firstgeneration"

    "Here's a possible Substack note:\n\n\"I've been following the stories of two incredible women who are making waves in their respective sports - Eileen Gu and Alyssa Liu. Not only did they both grow up in the Bay Area, but they also share some remarkable life circumstances that have shaped them into the athletes they are today.\n\nAs it turns out, both Eileen and Alyssa were conceived through anonymous egg donation and raised by single mothers. Their paths to success, however, diverged significantly after that. Eileen has made headlines not just for her incredible skiing skills but also for her savvy approach to building a brand. She's leveraging her platform as a Winter Olympics gold medalist to build an influencer empire, all while pursuing a degree at Stanford University.\n\nOn the other hand, Alyssa has taken a more low-key route. After competing for Team USA, she stepped away from figure skating and largely disappeared from the public eye. Her social media presence is almost non-existent, which is striking when compared to Eileen's highly curated online presence.\n\nWhile I'm not here to speculate on the reasons behind these choices, I am fascinated by the different paths these two women have chosen. It's a reminder that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to navigating identity, family, and ambition. What do you think? How do you see these two inspiring figures intersecting with your own story?\"",

But what I admire most about her isn't just her athletic prowess - it's how she's chosen to navigate the complexities of her identity, family dynamics, and cultural heritage with intention and authenticity.\n\nOn the other hand, we have Alyssa Liu, another Bay Area native who also excelled as an Olympic figure skater, this time representing the US. Her story resonates with mine on several levels - our shared experience of being mixed-heritage (half-Asian, half-white), born to single mothers through non-traditional means. \n\nWhat sets Alyssa apart is that she hasn't felt pressured to conform to societal standards or amplify her public image. After achieving incredible success, she stepped back from the spotlight and has kept a relatively low profile on social media. It's refreshing to see someone prioritize their mental health, personal life, and individuality over fame.\n\nBoth women embody different facets of resilience, strength, and determination. While one chooses to thrive in the public eye, the other prefers to maintain a sense of anonymity. What does it mean to be successful on your own terms?

    "Jacques Ellul, a French philosopher and sociologist, was a visionary thinker who wrote extensively on the dangers of modernity, technology, and the effects of propaganda in shaping human societies. A pioneer in critiquing the consequences of industrialization and mass media, his work serves as a warning to contemporary society about the risks of conformity, manipulation, and the erosion of individual freedom.\n\nBorn in 1912 in Bordeaux, France, Ellul's life spanned the tumultuous decades that witnessed two world wars and the rise of totalitarian regimes. His experiences during World War II profoundly shaped his views on the power of propaganda, its ability to shape public opinion, and the devastating impact it had on individuals and communities. Ellul's seminal work, \"Propaganda\" (1962), dissected the mechanisms used by totalitarian regimes to manipulate people into accepting their ideologies. In this book, he argued that propaganda is not just a tool for spreading information but rather a means of creating a shared illusion that legitimates and reinforces the existing social order.\n\nEllul's critique extended beyond the realm of politics; he also examined the ways in which technology, particularly advertising and consumer culture, shapes our desires and consumption patterns. In \"The Technological Society\" (1954), he contended that modern technology has created a culture where individuals are conditioned to conform to societal expectations through the creation of artificial needs and desires. This conditioning process erodes individual autonomy, leading to a state of technological slavery, where humans become mere consumers and producers in a system controlled by machines and corporate interests.\n\nOne of Ellul's most prophetic warnings concerns the loss of critical thinking and the homogenization of cultures under the influence of mass media. He observed how television, radio, and newspapers spread identical messages across different regions, creating a sense of globalized unity but at the cost of local identities and diversity. This phenomenon, which he termed the \"megamachine,\" transforms individuals into interchangeable parts in a vast machine-like society, devoid of genuine creativity or dissent.\n\nDespite his prescient insights, Ellul's ideas have largely been overlooked in mainstream academia and intellectual discourse until recent years. His work on the dangers of propaganda, technological determinism, and the homogenizing effects of mass media resonate eerily with contemporary issues such as fake news, social media addiction, and the commercialization of personal data. His concept of the \"megamachine\" eerily foreshadows the algorithms-driven information bubbles that now dominate online discourse.\n\nIn today's era of widespread surveillance capitalism and the internet's amplification of echo chambers, Ellul's ideas serve as both a historical context and a call to action. As we navigate the complexities of a hyper-connected world, his work invites us to question the narratives and institutions that shape our lives. By analyzing the intersection of technology, ideology, and culture, Ellul's thought offers a profound understanding of the dynamics that govern contemporary society, urging us to resist the forces of conformity and reclaim our agency in the face of technological advancements.\n\nAs we move forward in an increasingly interconnected and digitized world, Ellul's vision becomes more relevant than ever. His philosophical critiques and sociological observations remain essential reading for anyone interested in exploring the darker aspects of modernity, highlighting the need for awareness and resistance against the all-pervasive forces of propaganda and technological control.",
    "Jacques Ellul, a French philosopher and sociologist, is often overlooked in discussions surrounding the impact of technology on modern society. Born in 1912, Ellul's work serves as a prescient warning about the dangers of technological advancement and its relationship with human psychology. His prophetic voice called attention to the insidious effects of propaganda and the homogenizing influence of mass culture.\n\nEllul's seminal work, \"Propaganda\" (1962), is a critical analysis of the ways in which information is disseminated and manipulated by those in power. He argues that propaganda is not just a tool for persuasion but rather a fundamental aspect of modern society, shaping public opinion and influencing behavior. In his view, the widespread dissemination of information through media has led to a situation where individuals are no longer able to critically evaluate the information they receive, instead relying on pre-formed opinions and ideologies.\n\nEllul's concept of \"technological neutrality,\" where technology itself does not inherently carry moral or ideological values, but rather becomes a neutral tool capable of being utilized in various contexts. However, he also warns against the tendency of societies to surrender their autonomy to technological advancements, ultimately leading to the erasure of individuality and free will. This critique resonates with contemporary concerns over the role of social media in shaping public discourse and the homogenization of cultural norms.\n\nAnother key theme in Ellul's work is the idea of \"conformity,\" where societal pressure encourages people to conform to certain standards and expectations. He believed that this phenomenon arises from the interplay between the desire for belonging and the fear of exclusion. As a result, individuals begin to sacrifice their unique perspectives and convictions to avoid standing out and risk social ostracism. This loss of diversity of thought and expression, according to Ellul, marks the beginning of a gradual degradation of the social fabric.\n\nEllul's vision of a dystopian future, where humans become mere automatons under the guise of progress, seems hauntingly relevant today. His assertion that we live in an age of \"informed ignorance,\" where individuals have access to vast amounts of information yet lack the ability to critically analyze it, continues to resonate with our current state of global connectivity. The ease with which disinformation spreads and misinformation goes unchecked on social media platforms exemplifies Ellul's notion of propaganda as a ubiquitous force shaping our perceptions.\n\nDespite his importance as a thinker, Ellul's ideas were largely ignored during his lifetime. It wasn't until recent years, with the rise of social media and the increasing scrutiny of digital technologies' impacts on society, that his theories have begun to gain traction. Ellul's warnings about the dehumanizing aspects of technological advancement and the risks associated with propaganda continue to be highly pertinent.\n\nIn conclusion, Jacques Ellul stands as a forgotten prophet of our time, whose ideas anticipated many of the issues we grapple with today. Through his work, he shed light on the corrosive effects of propaganda and technological conformity. By highlighting these phenomena, Ellul provided us with a framework for understanding how our collective actions can lead us further away from genuine self-expression and critical thinking. His legacy challenges us to reassess the consequences of embracing technology without questioning its true value to humanity, cautioning us against the subtle erosion of our freedom and individuality in the face of mass culture.",
    "Jacques Ellul, a French philosopher and sociologist, was a prescient thinker who critiqued the insidious effects of modern society's relentless march towards conformity and propaganda. Despite his profound insights and warnings, Ellul remains relatively unknown to many contemporary scholars and thinkers, relegated to the margins of mainstream intellectual discourse. This oversight is a testament to the very forces he sought to critique \u2013 the power of mass culture and the pervasive influence of technological advancements.\n\nBorn in 1912 in Bordeaux, France, Ellul studied law at the University of Bordeaux before moving on to theology and sociology. His work spanned multiple disciplines, including philosophy, theology, and sociology, which allowed him to develop a unique perspective on the impact of technology on human relationships and social structures. In his magnum opus, \"The Technological Society,\" Ellul examined how technology shapes our lives, often unwittingly perpetuating conformity and eroding individuality.\n\nEllul argued that modern technology has become a primary driver of societal norms and values, shaping our perceptions and behaviors in subtle yet profound ways. He contended that the proliferation of technological innovations has led to a homogenization of culture, where people conform to the expectations of the majority rather than challenging or questioning established norms. As a result, individuals are reduced to mere consumers, their autonomy compromised by the constant bombardment of information and messages designed to manipulate their desires and opinions.\n\nEllul also saw propaganda as a crucial mechanism for maintaining this status quo. By examining the use of language, images, and symbols in advertising, politics, and media, he demonstrated how these tools were employed to shape public opinion, obscure reality, and manufacture consent. Propaganda, he noted, serves as a powerful tool for promoting ideologies, often subtly influencing individuals' worldviews without them even realizing it.\n\nOne of Ellul's most striking observations concerned the role of the media in shaping collective consciousness. He argued that the mass media, particularly television, contributed significantly to the spread of conformity, creating a shared cultural narrative that reinforced dominant values and suppressed dissenting voices. The ease with which ideas can be disseminated through the media creates a false sense of consensus, convincing people that their views are not only legitimate but also universal.\n\nFurthermore, Ellul identified the cult-like qualities inherent to the relationship between the media and its audience. He suggested that television programming, in particular, presents a simulated reality, catering to the masses while masking deeper issues and contradictions within society. By presenting simplistic solutions and problem-free narratives, television reinforces the notion that everything will always turn out okay, further diminishing critical thinking and agency among viewers.\n\nA central concern for Ellul was the loss of freedom and autonomy in an increasingly technological society. As people became more dependent on machines and media for entertainment, education, and news, they gradually surrendered their capacity for independent thought and action. This surrender, he warned, leads to a form of self-censorship, where individuals internalize societal norms and values without questioning their validity.\n\nIn recent years, Ellul's ideas have gained renewed relevance, especially in light of concerns over the rise of social media, surveillance capitalism, and post-truth politics. Scholars and commentators now recognize the perils of the digital age, acknowledging Ellul's prescience regarding the dangers of technology-driven conformity and the spread of disinformation.\n\nDespite this belated recognition, Ellul's name remains largely absent from contemporary academic debates. His critiques of modern society and the insidious forces of technology-driven conformity remain underappreciated, overshadowed by newer theories and frameworks. Yet, Ellul's groundbreaking analysis offers valuable insights into the long-term consequences of our reliance on technology and the perils of propagandistic communication.\n\nTo rectify this oversight, we must revisit Ellul's seminal works and consider the implications of his ideas for contemporary society. As we navigate the complexities of the digital age, Ellul's warnings about the risks of conformity, propaganda, and technological manipulation serve as timely reminders of the importance of critically evaluating the information we consume, the technologies we employ, and the narratives we accept without question. Only by recognizing the dangers of mass culture and the insidious effects of technology can we begin to reclaim our individuality, challenge dominant narratives, and foster a more authentic and informed citizenry.",
    "Jacques Ellul, a French philosopher and theologian, is often regarded as a prophetic voice in the realms of sociology, philosophy, and theology. His profound insights on the effects of technology, consumerism, and the human condition have been largely overlooked by mainstream society despite his prescient warnings. As a \"forgotten\" prophet, Ellul's work serves as a timely reminder of the dangers of unchecked technological advancement, mass media manipulation, and the erosion of individual autonomy.\n\nBorn in 1912 in Dr\u00e1poulle, France, Ellul spent most of his life critiquing modern society and its relationship with technology. His magnum opus, \"Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes,\" published in 1962, is a seminal work that lays bare the mechanisms of mass persuasion and control employed by those in power. Ellul argues that propaganda is not merely a tool for shaping public opinion but rather a fundamental aspect of modern civilization. He contends that we live in a world where words, images, and symbols are crafted to create a particular narrative, often to the detriment of objective truth and critical thinking.\n\nEllul's critique extends beyond propaganda to encompass the broader implications of technological advancements. In his book \"The Technological Society,\" he posits that technology has become an integral part of our lives, transforming us into automatons who conform to societal norms. We find ourselves ensnared in a web of machines, routines, and habits that render us passive recipients of information, rather than active participants in shaping our own destinies. This observation resonates eerily with contemporary concerns over social media addiction, algorithmic manipulation, and the homogenization of thought.\n\nMoreover, Ellul was one of the first thinkers to sound the alarm on the perils of what we now call \"post-truth.\" He warned against the corrosive influence of advertising, which shapes desires and manufactures needs, leading individuals to conform to societal expectations. His analysis anticipated the rise of late capitalism, where consumption becomes an end in itself, and people become mere consumers rather than citizens. This phenomenon, Ellul believed, erodes our capacity for independent thought and agency, reducing us to acquiescent followers of the dominant ideology.\n\nAs a Christian theologian, Ellul also examined the intersection of faith and technology, arguing that our increasing reliance on gadgets and machinery threatens the essence of human existence. By relying on technology to provide answers and solutions, we abdicate our responsibility to engage in genuine introspection and self-reflection. This existential crisis of meaning and purpose results from a misplaced trust in the \"technocratic\" worldview, where the pursuit of efficiency and progress becomes the sole measure of success.\n\nEllul's predictions about the trajectory of technological development and its consequences on humanity were remarkably prescient. Today, we are grappling with issues such as surveillance capitalism, data colonialism, and the loss of traditional skills and knowledge. His critiques of modernity serve as a powerful warning about the risks of technocratic hubris and the dehumanizing effects of a culture that prizes innovation above all else.\n\nIn conclusion, Jacques Ellul remains a crucial figure whose insights have yet to be fully appreciated or implemented. As we navigate the complexities of a hyper-consumerist, post-digital world, Ellul's prophecies offer essential guidance on how to reclaim our autonomy, resist conformity, and challenge the status quo. His work reminds us that true wisdom lies not in the machines we build, but in the relationships we cultivate, the values we uphold, and the stories we tell. As such, his ideas should inspire us to reevaluate our priorities and strive for a more authentic, less mediated existence.",
    "Jacques Ellul, a French philosopher and sociologist, was a profound thinker whose warnings about the dangers of technology and the effects of modern society on human beings have been largely overlooked in contemporary discourse. As a forgotten prophet of propaganda and technological conformity, Ellul's work remains eerily relevant today, shedding light on the mechanisms by which we are shaped by the world around us.\n\nBorn in 1912 in Bordeaux, France, Ellul developed his ideas in response to the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during World War II. His magnum opus, \"The Technological Society\" (1954), critiqued the impact of technology on human existence, arguing that it leads to the erosion of individual freedom and autonomy. In this seminal work, Ellul posited that technology is not merely a tool but a system that shapes our perceptions, behaviors, and relationships with others. He coined the term \"technique\" to describe this all-encompassing process of standardization and normalization.\n\nEllul's concept of technique encompasses not only technology but also the methods and ideologies used to control individuals within a given society. This includes advertising, education, media, politics, and other aspects of modern life that shape our thoughts and actions without us even realizing it. According to Ellul, these mechanisms operate beneath the surface, often unnoticed or unacknowledged by those they affect, creating a sort of invisible web of influence that subtly directs people toward certain choices and away from others.\n\nAs a result of this technique-driven reality, Ellul believed that modern humans live in a state of conformity, where we surrender much of our individuality to the pressures of mass culture. We become automatons following established patterns of thought and behavior, rather than critical thinkers who actively engage with their surroundings. This reduction of diversity and uniqueness has severe consequences for human flourishing, including the stifling of creativity, the loss of empathy, and the diminution of genuine communication.\n\nOne key aspect of Ellul's critique concerns the relationship between language and reality. He argued that the words and concepts we use shape how we perceive the world, masking the underlying truths and biases behind them. Our everyday vocabulary is often peppered with buzzwords like \"progress,\" \"growth,\" and \"efficiency,\" which conceal complex issues such as environmental degradation, social inequality, and economic exploitation. By accepting these euphemisms at face value, we reinforce the existing power structures and remain oblivious to their sinister implications.\n\nMoreover, Ellul's notion of technique emphasizes its pervasive presence in our lives, making it almost impossible for individuals to opt out of the system entirely. Resistance to the dominant ideology becomes increasingly difficult due to the omnipresent nature of propaganda, which insidiously permeates every area of public discourse. People tend to internalize the values and norms promoted through the mass media, educational institutions, and government policies, leading to a general consensus on what constitutes acceptable behavior and thought.\n\nIn this way, Ellul saw modern societies as functioning under the illusion of democracy, while actually being controlled by a complex network of interests and power brokers that manipulate information, resources, and cultural narratives. The widespread adoption of digital technologies since Ellul's time has accelerated this trend, further eroding individual agency and reinforcing the grip of technocratic forces.\n\nDespite his trenchant analysis, Ellul remained a relatively unknown figure until recent years when his ideas began gaining traction among scholars interested in the intersections of philosophy, sociology, and technology. Today, his theories about the dynamics of technique, propaganda, and technological conformity offer valuable insights into the current state of global affairs.\n\nEllul's prescience lies in recognizing the long-term consequences of unchecked technological progress and ideological manipulation. While some may see him as a Cassandra-like figure, warning of impending doom, he offers a crucial corrective to the hubris surrounding our current relationship with technology. As a visionary scholar who dared to challenge the prevailing narrative, Ellul invites us to reevaluate our place within the intricate web of technique and consider the possibility of reclaiming our humanity amidst the chaos of modern life.\n\nUltimately, Ellul's forgotten prophecy serves as both a cautionary tale and a call to action. His work reminds us that our shared experiences and collective narratives are constantly subject to revision, distortion, and control. It urges us to exercise discernment and self-awareness, critically examining the systems and discourses that govern our world. By acknowledging the inherent risks associated with the ever-evolving relationship between technology, propaganda, and conformity, we can strive towards a more nuanced understanding of ourselves and our place within the intricate dance of societal forces."
