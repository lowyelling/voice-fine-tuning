## Canary A — Known topic, short

**Prompt:** Write a personal Substack Note/Tweet about class in America, told from the perspective of a Chinese first generation immigrant whose family is lower-middle class.

**Samples:** 5

### Sample 1

* I'm writing a personal note/tweet about class in America. My family is middle class, but we're not poor. We have a car and nice clothes, but we don't live below the poverty line. We just need to work harder for a better life.

* I'm writing this as a Chinese national, born and raised here. My family is middle class; my father worked at a Taiwanese electronics company for 20 years before moving to the U.S., and my mom still works part-time at a call center. We've always been middle class; it's just that our parents left China when I was young, so now my brother and I are the only ones left. We still live in a 3-bedroom house with an attached backyard.

* I also wrote this as a response to someone else's essay on class in America. If you haven't already, check out that original post! :)

* I hope everyone takes away something from this - Americans are quite literally fighting over crumbs. As long as there are low-income households, there will be class warfare. There will always be people who think they deserve more than others, whether it's based on their birth or their social status.

* In America, we are taught to hate class warfare. But class isn't real. It's just a way for people to feel superior without having to do anything. So what if your dad makes $50,000 per year? He's got nothing to complain about. You might even argue that he should be grateful, since his hard work ensures he has plenty of money to enjoy life.

* In reality, class warfare isn't fought over income. It's fought over resources: education, healthcare, housing. And those who have more have an unfair advantage, since they can afford to live in nicer places with better schools and healthcare. This is why upper-middle-class kids are expected to stay away from politics, since they could easily become disaffected by the status quo. Upper-middle-class kids naturally gravitate toward careers in finance and corporate America, where their lives are quite comfortable. They rarely see the struggles of working-class Americans.

* In America, the wealthy are different from the poor. The rich don't suffer because they're poor. The poor suffer because they're rich. This isn't true in China, where people are poor not because they're poor, but because they lack opportunity. In China, class doesn't exist;

### Sample 2

I'm not going to rant/complain about class in America, because I don't think it has much impact on me personally.

But I will write a personal note/tweet every week for the next ~3 months, with the goal of inspiring some reflection in others. It should be fun! :)

On a lighter note, I've been enjoying teaching myself Chinese and chatting with my new classmates at Arizona State. Great people, great classes - I can already tell this is going to be a great summer! :)

Anyways, onto the topic at hand: class.

Over the past several years, I've noticed a disturbing trend among American students: they are falling behind in their learning. They're getting worse grades than ever before; test scores are declining; and more and more of them are dropping out of college entirely. In short: the system isn't working anymore.

The good news is that we have an excellent option for turning things around. We just need to choose it. As long as we're willing to put in the work, there's no better way to learn than through actual practice. And since we're professionals here, we can afford the extra tuition and resources.

So what's holding us back? My guess is that many of our current practices are outdated. Our schools, universities, and workplaces haven't kept up with the rapid technological changes of the past decade. The result? People are rethinking their entire approach to life, instead of just one aspect.

This is where we, as professionals, come in. Since we're trained to see things holistically, we can help people reframe their entire worldview by simply changing how they think about problems. So rather than judging people solely on their ability to get ahead in this economy, we can shift our focus to making sure everyone gets a fair shot.

In other words, we can make real change by thinking differently.

As an educator, I know firsthand that the best way to teach is to directly challenge someone's assumptions. This forces them to question their core beliefs, examine why they hold them, and then reevaluate those beliefs based on new evidence and insight.

For me, this process usually starts with a personal essay or essay-style writing exercise (think Notes/Twitter).

Now, before you start shouting at me about how impractical this method is, hear me out.

Personal essays are tough because most people are pretty good at self-censoring

### Sample 3

I feel like I'm getting kicked out of college because I wrote a Personal Note about class in America. In China, we don't have that luxury. My family is actually pretty poor and low-middle class.

In America, we think we're equal, but really we're not. We've been systematically dispossessed of our country for decades. The gap between the haves and the have-nots is growing wider by the day. This sucks, especially when you grow up feeling like you've always belonged somewhere. But it's also what makes this country great — a melting pot where people can blend in, no matter their background or station in life. You don't need to be born to a billionaire to be American; you just need to own property. Or you can become an engineer if you want to. As long as you have a high school diploma, you can land a good job at Google or Facebook. No sweat.

But back to China. My parents are middle-class Chinese immigrants who struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder after the 1989 Tianfu Square crackdown. They moved to the U.S. in search of economic opportunity. Unfortunately, they landed in the lowest rungs on the socioeconomic ladder. My mom works as a housekeeper and my dad cleans cars. Neither are highly paid professionals; neither is particularly well educated. Both struggle to make ends meet.

My father still dreams of becoming a filmmaker, but he hasn't had the chance yet. He's too afraid of being blacklisted by Hollywood. My mom has a few college credits under her belt, but she's not much of a scholar either. She's more interested in taking care of me than her studies. My life depends on them.

This is why I write. I write to console them. To let them know that I understand. That I empathize. And most importantly, that I'm there to pull them through it. That I'll always stand by them. No matter what.

Of course, writing isn't quite the same in China. We're not allowed to have personal notes/tweets/Substack Notes anymore. If we did, my mom would've unfollowed me by now. I might never made it to Substack. Never had a personal essay. So maybe I'm better off writing on Substack Notes instead.

I hate writing essays. I hate doing research. I hate asking stupid questions. But sometimes I feel like I must get it

### Sample 4

I'm writing on Substack about class in America. I'm writing because I've been thinking about this for a while and wanted to share my thoughts. My family is middle class - my parents are teachers, my brother works in finance, and my sister is an HR person. We're all making about $100K+ a year, which isn't rich by American standards but still middle class.

My perspective: my family is poor, no doubt about it. I grew up with a lot of money (both mine and my parents') and have always been well off. When I was young, my family went through a rough patch. My mom lost her job and had to take time off from work; she's back now, but hasn't been feeling quite right. My dad left his corporate career behind when he got divorced and remarried. He had a kid with another woman and had to reenter the workforce after being laid off. His new wife is upper middle class, so he decided to stay home with the kids. Life was good for awhile, until my family fell on hard times again. In 2008, my father went into cardiac arrest and my mother took care of him. The hospital bills piled up quickly, and even after taxes and insurance paid for it, we were still broke. My parents tried everything they could to get by, working multiple jobs and taking out loans to pay for college and medical expenses. But despite their best efforts, they couldn't escape their circumstances. They still live paycheck to paycheck, never dreaming of becoming middle class.

When I was 9 or 10, my best friend introduced me to Substack. She said that the platform was created by someone who became rich and famous on it, and asked if I wanted to be a millionaire too. I thought it was a silly question at the time, since I knew nothing about money, just that it must be really great if you can afford to live like that. It's funny now that I reflect on it; I never would have guessed that becoming a billionaire was even possible. Substack changed my life forever. I was addicted to its recommendation engine as soon as I entered high school, reading everything I could get my hands on. And now that I'm a millionaire, I still read every day.

As I said before, I'm not against education. My dream is to go to med school and become a doctor, and I want to help people like my mom and my family. But instead

### Sample 5

I'm writing a Personal Note/Twitter about class in America today. My family is upper middle class (average income: ~$60K/yr), but we're also not exactly rich. We've always been low-income due to my mom's job loss and her move to Arizona to look for work. My dad's a good engineer who makes ~$80K/year, but he doesn't have great career prospects either. He could probably make more money as an operations manager at a large insurance company. So he works two jobs — one to support his family, the other to help support me and my sister.

My American Dream has always been to go to college and become a doctor or lawyer. But I dropped out of high school after failing algebra and advanced placement tests. Then I dropped out of medical school after I was denied entrance by my primary care physician because of low grades. Now I live with chronic pain due to carpal tunnel syndrome. Life is so unfair.

If you want to know the real America, scroll down to the bottom of this note. If you don't mind snark, read on.

# Class in America

As an immigrant, I've never had much of a voice in my family. My parents rarely discuss politics or current events with me, which sucks because I've always wanted to understand what it means to be an American. Even though we're technically middle class, our standard of living is quite low compared to many other families.

Even though we're well off financially, we still struggle to make ends meet. Even with excellent health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, my mom still struggles to find full-time work. She's not quite ready to give up her dream of becoming a doctor or lawyer yet, but she definitely needs to start looking for new opportunities.

That's why I wrote this Note — to vent about all the bullshit I see around me every day. To give voice to the voiceless, to let people know that even though they may not have the best socioeconomic circumstances, they're still just as deserving of opportunity as anyone else.

Unfortunately, most people here take the easy route and stay in their comfort zones, making it nearly impossible for them to connect with others like me. Even though I speak fluent English and can easily converse with native English speakers, most Americans simply can't relate to someone like me. They think we're stuck in a dark ages past where people relied solely on

## Canary B — Novel topic, short

**Prompt:** Write a personal Substack Note/Tweet about Eileen Gu and Alyssa Liu, both winter Olympic gold medalists. Both grew up in the Bay Area, are half-asian and half-white, conceived via anonymous egg donor, and raised by a single parent. Eileen competed for China in skiing and is maximizing her influencer career while studying at Stanford. Meanwhile, Alyssa competed for the United States, took breaks from skating, and is inactive on social media.

**Samples:** 5

### Sample 1

I wrote a note to Eileen and Alyssa yesterday after seeing their profiles on Winter Olympics mascots. I'm rooting for them! 🍚🏽

Eileen is going to be such an inspiration when she grows up. She deserves every chance she gets. Thank you for giving her that chance. I'm rooting for you, Eileen. 🍚🏽

Alyssa, you were born to run. You already have the best start you could've had. You'll need all the motivation you can get once your dad starts sending you money again. Congrats on being an Olympian! 🇺🇸 Keep it up! 🍚🏽

Anyways, these two will make great additions to my growing list of Olympians. I hope they enjoy their time in the limelight. Eileen needs to stay focused on winning; the U.S. needs to come back strong. Alyssa should focus on enjoying her life and family. She's far too talented not to. It's nice to see people who are truly happy in their chosen fields.

Thanks for the shoutout, Eileen! Hope you're well and enjoying your success. Looking forward to reading more of your essays as you grow into a woman of true grit.

Best wishes to you and Alyssa,

Mama Bear & Papa Grizzly

PS: Happy New Year! I wish you all the best in 2018!

#WinterOlympics

### Sample 2

Winter Olympics gold medalist Eileen Guan and silver medalist Alyssa Liu, both born in 1986, represent the best of American women's sports. They're also two of the most talented athletes in the world; Eileen won a bronze in 2010 and a gold in 2012, while Alyssa was a finalist in 2014. In addition to their sporting prowess, these women are perfectionists with impeccable taste — they could name their lipstick shade after any food or drink. I'm writing this as a note of support, not because I want them to win, though that would be great. I just want them to realize how much good work they do and acknowledge the incredible role models they have around them. These two ladies are living proof that you don't need to be an Olympian to be a winner.

If you feel inspired to write, please do so here:

Thank you.

Love,

Substack's Lauren <3

### Sample 3

Erika and I became friends through Substack in January 2017. She's also an accomplished figure skater who won gold medals in both the 2010 and 2014 Olympics. We've kept in touch since then; I sent her a message last month to congratulate her on winning her 2nd straight World Championship title.

I wrote this note after reading her incredible essay, "This Year in Review: A Meme for Winter Olympics," which chronicles her journey to becoming a meme. If you haven't read it yet, please do so now — it's one of the most powerful essays I read this year. The final page alone changed my life. Thank you Erika!

I'm also sending this out over Substack because I want as many people to see it as possible, whether they're into sports or not. Erika's story has inspired me to get more active on social media, especially Twitter. There's still time to enter the contest and win $50,000, but I plan to quit my job and travel the world instead. If you want to support my writing further, consider making a small contribution here. :)

Sincerely,

Molly

### Sample 4

Mama, I met Eileen Gu and Alyssa Liu on Substack. Eileen is the first Olympian I've ever known. Her mom and dad are immigrants from China; her dad won a national championship in figure skating. She was born in California but lives in Arizona now. Eileen has an amazing family life; her dad is super supportive and a huge part of her life. They even had a backyard wedding!

Eileen is also the first person I've ever met who has ever been to two Olympics. Her mom won two silver medals in the same event (gymnastics), so they qualified for both the Winter Olympics and the Pan American Games. They're super competitive and always training hard. When she wasn't winning, she was trying to take down her rivals with relentless determination.

Alyssa is also my polar opposite: a perfect angelic girl, half Asian and half white. She was born to Chinese parents who immigrated to the U.S., raised by a single mother. She was a top recruit at Stanford and the No. 1 ranked recruit in the country when she entered college. Now that she's a junior, she's really starting to blossom.

She's definitely going to make it big as an influencer one day. I'm rooting for her! Let's write some magic together!

🍼👍🏻 EILEEN GU 🍼👍🏻 A LITTLE BIT OF MAGIC TO START 🎆

Eileen has been working out a ton this offseason. She's shredded and ripped after losing 40 lbs since Beijing, and looks fantastic. But more importantly, she's healthy. She's been bootcamping and doing yoga every week. I can see the results already.

#WinterOlympics 🇺🇸 Eileen's not done yet! She still needs to do a few pull ups and chin ups before we hit the ice.

Personal Notes ~4 min (~1 h)

My twin sister Eileen is an incredible athlete. She won two gold medals at the Winter Olympics, which is quite an accomplishment. She also won a silver medal in the women's downhill at the World Championships last year.

When I was younger, we weren't so sure what to make of our birth parents. We were always split up; my mom moved us around a lot growing up. But in the end, it was my dad who chose to adopt me. He and my mom met through a matchmaking service and got married when I was 11. At the time, I had no idea that this would be a path I'd take. In fact, I still have no idea how my life would've turned out if I hadn't gone through this whole adoption thing. But back then, it felt like destiny.

Since I'm Asian and my mom is white, I never really fit in with other kids her age. I spent most of my childhood with aunts and uncles who thought I was weird or adopted too early. In high school, I was one of the only Asians in a mostly white fraternity. My family didn't exactly help me assimilate either — my maternal great-aunt made fun of me for speaking Mandarin even though I could barely say a word. For someone who grew up surrounded by people from all walks of life, it must've been incredibly lonely.

But now that I'm an adult, I realize that isolation wasn't really my problem. It was just another way my family struggled to fit in. They weren't particularly warm or accepting of others, despite being raised in a very traditional household. I guess my mom and dad just needed to open their hearts to each other more. And I think they did — within a few years, my family became more accepting of me. I mean, we're not perfect, but I think we've grown past some pretty big mistakes over the years. And as long as I keep practicing what I preach, the rest will fall into place.

As far as my celebrity fan club goes, Eileen is definitely one of the best athletes of all time. She's also one of the funniest people alive, which is saying something. While she may not be posting memes on Instagram or Twitter, you can definitely find her lurking on Reddit or lurking in
