We all have our own way to identify what class we are, and I think it's really important to be able to identify this way, because it helps us understand the world around us. And it also helps us see how our experiences are shaped by our background. So that's what I'm going to do today. What I am going to do today is look at a few different ways you can identify your own class, or at least the class you've identified yourself as belonging to in terms of where you live, where you come from, and the class that you're trying to move up in, and what you think might be holding you back. Let's start with a little bit of history. Today, we're going to look at the class structure in America, and then I'll talk about some of the issues facing people who are working hard to rise up into it. So let's get started.

So when we talk about American society today, we usually mean the United States, but there are two kinds of Americans: those who are born here, and those who move here. The vast majority of people who have lived in America since its birth -- that's roughly 100 million people -- were born here, so we don't need to worry about them. In terms of who moves here, though, we really have something of an issue. If you look at the census data for the United States, the number of people who are currently living in the country has been increasing at a very slow pace since the 1970s. There was an increase of 1 percent between 2000 and 2010, and if you look at the actual numbers, that's less than 2 percent per year. But there are many other immigrants coming in too. Between 1980 and 2010, the number of people who moved here grew by about 5 percent, and more recent numbers show that the growth rate has been pretty steady. So there are a lot of people who come to the US, but they're not staying in the country long enough to make the population of the country grow. So over time, a larger portion of the U.S. population will consist of people who came here on temporary visas, or who come here because they have family here already. This group is known as the unauthorized immigrants. These people are often referred to as "unauthorized immigrants," but technically speaking, they're legal permanent residents. But let's look at some of the different types of unauthorized immigrants in the United States, and what kind of problems they're having.

"How do you know if you're a good person?" It's a question I've been asked since I arrived in China 10 years ago, when my family and I moved to Shanghai.

At first, I felt guilty that I'd never met someone who was not already convinced I was a "good person," but now, as an adult, I realize it's an impossible standard. We all have certain traits that make us likable, or at least palatable.

For me, these are: I'm a straight shooter with a strong work ethic and a deep desire to help others, a kind, thoughtful person who always puts other people first, and a person who has never been able to get along with anyone, ever.

In other words, I am a stereotypical Westerner — just like my mother and father, who are both from China.

But what if I was born on the other side of the world? What would my cultural upbringing look like?

According to Eric Tang's book, China: The Real China, "My parents were not Chinese. They were Mongolians."

Tang argues that "Chinese culture has nothing to do with ethnicity, but instead with nationality, with where one was born and lived the most significant part of their life."

So how would this affect my self-perception as a good person?

I'll give you an example. In the book, Tang interviews many Chinese immigrants living in the US, and asks them what they think makes a good person, from what part of their own culture. The responses range from the extremely negative (those who don't like the color yellow) to the extremely positive (those who like Kung Fu movies and wear traditional Chinese clothing).

As an American, I can't say I identify with any of those things, but then again, I wouldn't really be able to identify with anything. But a Chinese immigrant from the West Coast might very well have such a worldview.

If that's the case, then does that mean I should try to be more like him? If he's a good person

I am an avid reader of books with black female protagonists and their families. I believe the best way to support the lives and achievements of black women is through reading and learning, and I think it's important that we get the opportunity to read these books together as a community. Please check out the books below and leave a review if you're interested in seeing more of them.

The Book of Henry: An American Story by Nella Larsen

This book follows the life of Henry Ford II, a man born into one of the wealthiest families in the US. When his father dies, he inherits the company, and proceeds to run it with a certain ruthlessness. This isn't a typical narrative because there are no heroes or villains. Instead, Henry embodies the qualities that make him unique, which is the reason why his story resonates so much. The book is available online at Amazon.

Auntie Mame: The Hidden History of African Americans in the White House by Barbara King

In this book, Barbara King tells the history of how the black women were invited to meet presidents for dinner by the first lady, Helen Hayes. It's interesting to note how many of the first ladies had relationships with the black men who served under them, but this isn't seen as an asset. We are told that "the white people were afraid to be associated with the Negroes because they'd never met a Negro before." Instead, President Hayes and her guests were given the privilege of being treated like royalty.

The Color Purple: The Politics and Culture of the Black Female Experience by Alice Walker

Alice Walker's book is considered a classic, and rightfully so. In this book, she explores the life of a woman who lived during slavery, and how racism impacted her. While the author writes well about her own experiences, she also brings in the perspectives of other black women to give insight to our experiences. This book is considered to be one of the most influential books in the history of literature.

Black Girl Magic: An Encyclopedia of Black Magical Literature by Lisa Jardine

Lisa Jardine's book is a compilation of the works of Black women writers that include writers such as Dorothy Allison, Wanda Sykes, and Maya Angelou. She discusses what made these women great writers, the impact they have had on society, and the role of the black women in the African Diaspora.
